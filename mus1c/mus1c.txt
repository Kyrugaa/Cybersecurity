Description
I wrote you a song. Put it in the picoCTF{} flag format.


Hints:

Do you think you can master rockstar?



Process:

wget


Pasting the program into the online interpreter, we get the following output:
114
114
114
111
99
107
110
114
110
48
49
49
51
114


This looks like ASCII, let's decode it:

ascii = """114
114
114
111
99
107
110
114
110
48
49
49
51
114
"""

for c in ascii.split():
    print(chr(int(c)), end='')


output:

rrrocknrn0113r

so the flag is:
picoCTF{rrrocknrn0113r}
