       curl - transfer a URL

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [1mcurl [options / URLs][0m

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mcurl  [22mis  a  tool for transferring data from or to a server. It supports these protocols: DICT, FILE, FTP,
       FTPS, GOPHER, GOPHERS, HTTP, HTTPS, IMAP, IMAPS, LDAP, LDAPS, MQTT, POP3, POP3S, RTMP, RTMPS,  RTSP,  SCP,
       SFTP,  SMB,  SMBS, SMTP, SMTPS, TELNET, TFTP, WS and WSS. The command is designed to work without user in‐
       teraction.

       curl offers a busload of useful tricks like proxy support, user authentication, FTP upload, HTTP post, SSL
       connections, cookies, file transfer resume and more. As you will see below, the number  of  features  will
       make your head spin.

       curl is powered by libcurl for all transfer‐related features. See [4mlibcurl(3)[24m for details.

[1mURL[0m
       The URL syntax is protocol‐dependent. You find a detailed description in RFC 3986.

       You  can  specify multiple URLs or parts of URLs by writing part sets within braces and quoting the URL as
       in:

         "http://site.{one,two,three}.com"

       or you can get sequences of alphanumeric series by using [] as in:

         "ftp://ftp.example.com/file[1‐100].txt"

         "ftp://ftp.example.com/file[001‐100].txt"    (with leading zeros)

         "ftp://ftp.example.com/file[a‐z].txt"

       Nested sequences are not supported, but you can use several ones next to each other:

         "http://example.com/archive[1996‐1999]/vol[1‐4]/part{a,b,c}.html"

       You can specify any amount of URLs on the command line. They will be fetched in a sequential manner in the
       specified order unless you use [4m-Z,[24m [4m--parallel[24m. You can specify command line options and URLs mixed and  in
       any order on the command line.

       You can specify a step counter for the ranges to get every Nth number or letter:

         "http://example.com/file[1‐100:10].txt"

         "http://example.com/file[a‐z:2].txt"

       When  using  [] or {} sequences when invoked from a command line prompt, you probably have to put the full
       URL within double quotes to avoid the shell from interfering with it. This also goes for other  characters
       treated special, like for example ’&’, ’?’ and ’*’.

       Provide the IPv6 zone index in the URL with an escaped percentage sign and the interface name. Like in

         "http://[fe80::3%25eth0]/"

       If  you  specify a URL without a protocol:// scheme, curl guesses what protocol you want. It then defaults
       to HTTP but assumes others based on often‐used host name prefixes. For example, for  host  names  starting
       with "ftp." curl assumes you want FTP.

       curl  attempts  to  re‐use connections when doing multiple file transfers, so that getting many files from
       the same server do not use multiple connects / handshakes. This improves speed. Connection re‐use can only
       be done for URLs specified for a single command line invocation and cannot be performed  between  separate
       curl runs.

[1mOUTPUT[0m
       If  not told otherwise, curl writes the received data to stdout. It can be instructed to instead save that
       data into a local file, using the [4m-o,[24m [4m--output[24m or [4m-O,[24m [4m--remote‐name[24m options. If  curl  is  given  multiple
       URLs to transfer on the command line, it similarly needs multiple options for where to save them.

       curl does not parse or otherwise "understand" the content it gets or writes as output. It does no encoding
       or decoding, unless explicitly asked to with dedicated command line options.

[1mPROTOCOLS[0m
       curl supports numerous protocols, or put in URL terms: schemes. Your particular build may not support them
       all.

       DICT   Lets you lookup words using online dictionaries.

       FILE   Read  or  write local files. curl does not support accessing file:// URL remotely, but when running
              on Microsoft Windows using the native UNC approach will work.

       FTP(S) curl supports the File Transfer Protocol with a lot of tweaks and levers.  With  or  without  using
              TLS.

       GOPHER(S)
              Retrieve files.

       HTTP(S)
              curl supports HTTP with numerous options and variations. It can speak HTTP version 0.9, 1.0, 1.1, 2
              and 3 depending on build options and the correct command line options.

       IMAP(S)
              Using the mail reading protocol, curl can "download" emails for you. With or without using TLS.

       LDAP(S)
              curl can do directory lookups for you, with or without TLS.

       MQTT   curl  supports  MQTT  version  3. Downloading over MQTT equals "subscribe" to a topic while upload‐
              ing/posting equals "publish" on a topic. MQTT over TLS is not supported (yet).

       POP3(S)
              Downloading from a pop3 server means getting a mail. With or without using TLS.

       RTMP(S)
              The Realtime Messaging Protocol is primarily used to server streaming media and curl  can  download
              it.

       RTSP   curl supports RTSP 1.0 downloads.

       SCP    curl supports SSH version 2 scp transfers.

       SFTP   curl supports SFTP (draft 5) done over SSH version 2.

       SMB(S) curl supports SMB version 1 for upload and download.

       SMTP(S)
              Uploading contents to an SMTP server means sending an email. With or without TLS.

       TELNET Telling  curl  to  fetch a telnet URL starts an interactive session where it sends what it reads on
              stdin and outputs what the server sends it.

       TFTP   curl can do TFTP downloads and uploads.

[1mPROGRESS METER[0m
       curl normally displays a progress meter during operations, indicating  the  amount  of  transferred  data,
       transfer  speeds  and estimated time left, etc. The progress meter displays the transfer rate in bytes per
       second. The suffixes (k, M, G, T, P) are 1024 based. For example 1k is 1024 bytes. 1M is 1048576 bytes.

       curl displays this data to the terminal by default, so if you invoke curl to do an  operation  and  it  is
       about to write data to the terminal, it [4mdisables[24m the progress meter as otherwise it would mess up the out‐
       put mixing progress meter and response data.

       If  you want a progress meter for HTTP POST or PUT requests, you need to redirect the response output to a
       file, using shell redirect (>), [4m-o,[24m [4m--output[24m or similar.

       This does not apply to FTP upload as that operation does not spit out any response data to the terminal.

       If you prefer a progress "bar" instead of the regular meter, [4m-#,[24m [4m--progress‐bar[24m is your  friend.  You  can
       also disable the progress meter completely with the [4m-s,[24m [4m--silent[24m option.

[1mVERSION[0m
       This  man  page describes curl 8.2.1. If you use a later version, chances are this man page does not fully
       document it. If you use an earlier version, this document tries to include version information about which
       specific version that introduced changes.

       You can always learn which the latest curl version is by running
       curl https://curl.se/info

[1mOPTIONS[0m
       Options start with one or two dashes. Many of the options require an additional value next to them.

       The short "single‐dash" form of the options, -d for example, may be used with or without a  space  between
       it and its value, although a space is a recommended separator. The long "double‐dash" form, [4m-d,[24m [4m--data[24m for
       example, requires a space between it and its value.

       Short  version  options that do not need any additional values can be used immediately next to each other,
       like for example you can specify all the options -O, -L and -v at once as -OLv.

       In general, all boolean options are enabled with --[1moption [22mand yet again disabled  with  --[1mno‐[22moption.  That
       is,  you  use the same option name but prefix it with "no‐". However, in this list we mostly only list and
       show the --option version of them.

       When [4m-:,[24m [4m--next[24m is used, it resets the parser state and you start again with a clean option state,  except
       for  the  options  that  are  "global". Global options will retain their values and meaning even after [4m-:,[0m
       [4m--next[24m.

       The following options are global:  [4m--fail‐early[24m,  [4m--libcurl[24m,  [4m--parallel‐immediate[24m,  [4m-Z,[24m  [4m--parallel[24m,  [4m-#,[0m
       [4m--progress‐bar[24m,  [4m--rate[24m, [4m-S,[24m [4m--show‐error[24m, [4m--stderr[24m, [4m--styled‐output[24m, [4m--trace‐ascii[24m, [4m--trace‐ids[24m, [4m--trace‐[0m
       [4mtime[24m, [4m--trace[24m and [4m-v,[24m [4m--verbose[24m.

       --abstract‐unix‐socket <path>
              (HTTP) Connect through an abstract Unix domain socket, instead of using the network.  Note: netstat
              shows the path of an abstract socket prefixed with ’@’, however the <path> argument should not have
              this leading character.

              If [4m--abstract‐unix‐socket[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐abstract‐unix‐socket socketpath https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐unix‐socket[24m. Added in 7.53.0.

       --alt‐svc <file name>
              (HTTPS) This option enables the alt‐svc parser in curl. If the file name points to an existing alt‐
              svc cache file, that will be used. After a completed transfer, the cache will be saved to the  file
              name again if it has been modified.

              Specify a "" file name (zero length) to avoid loading/saving and make curl just handle the cache in
              memory.

              If  this  option is used several times, curl will load contents from all the files but the last one
              will be used for saving.

              [4m--alt‐svc[24m can be used several times in a command line

              Example:
               curl ‐‐alt‐svc svc.txt https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐resolve[24m and [4m‐‐connect‐to[24m. Added in 7.64.1.

       --anyauth
              (HTTP) Tells curl to figure out authentication method by itself, and use the most  secure  one  the
              remote  site  claims  to  support. This is done by first doing a request and checking the response‐
              headers, thus possibly inducing an extra network round‐trip. This is used instead of setting a spe‐
              cific authentication method, which you can do with [4m--basic[24m, [4m--digest[24m, [4m--ntlm[24m, and [4m--negotiate[24m.

              Using [4m--anyauth[24m is not recommended if you do uploads from stdin, since it may require  data  to  be
              sent twice and then the client must be able to rewind. If the need should arise when uploading from
              stdin, the upload operation will fail.

              Used together with [4m-u,[24m [4m--user[24m.

              Providing [4m--anyauth[24m multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐anyauth ‐‐user me:pwd https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐proxy‐anyauth[24m, [4m‐‐basic[24m and [4m‐‐digest[24m.

       -a, --append
              (FTP SFTP) When used in an upload, this makes curl append to the target file instead of overwriting
              it.  If  the remote file does not exist, it will be created. Note that this flag is ignored by some
              SFTP servers (including OpenSSH).

              Providing [4m-a,[24m [4m--append[24m multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it again with --no‐append.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐upload‐file local ‐‐append ftp://example.com/

              See also [4m‐r,[24m [4m‐‐range[24m and [4m‐C,[24m [4m‐‐continue‐at[24m.

       --aws‐sigv4 <provider1[:provider2[:region[:service]]]>
              Use AWS V4 signature authentication in the transfer.

              The provider argument is a string that is used by the algorithm when creating outgoing  authentica‐
              tion headers.

              The region argument is a string that points to a geographic area of a resources collection (region‐
              code) when the region name is omitted from the endpoint.

              The  service argument is a string that points to a function provided by a cloud (service‐code) when
              the service name is omitted from the endpoint.

              If [4m--aws‐sigv4[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐aws‐sigv4 "aws:amz:us‐east‐2:es" ‐‐user "key:secret" https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐basic[24m and [4m‐u,[24m [4m‐‐user[24m. Added in 7.75.0.

       --basic
              (HTTP) Tells curl to use HTTP Basic authentication with the remote host. This is  the  default  and
              this option is usually pointless, unless you use it to override a previously set option that sets a
              different authentication method (such as [4m--ntlm[24m, [4m--digest[24m, or [4m--negotiate[24m).

              Used together with [4m-u,[24m [4m--user[24m.

              Providing [4m--basic[24m multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl ‐u name:password ‐‐basic https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐proxy‐basic[24m.

       --ca‐native
              (TLS)  Tells  curl  to use the CA store from the native operating system to verify the peer. By de‐
              fault, curl will otherwise use a CA store provided in a single file or directory,  but  when  using
              this option it will interface the operating system’s own vault.

              This option only works for curl on Windows when built to use OpenSSL. When curl on Windows is built
              to use Schannel, this feature is implied and curl then only uses the native CA store.

              Providing [4m--ca‐native[24m multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it again with --no‐ca‐native.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐ca‐native https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐cacert[24m, [4m‐‐capath[24m and [4m‐k,[24m [4m‐‐insecure[24m. Added in 8.2.0.

       --cacert <file>
              (TLS)  Tells  curl  to  use the specified certificate file to verify the peer. The file may contain
              multiple CA certificates. The certificate(s) must be in PEM format. Normally curl is built to use a
              default file for this, so this option is typically used to alter that default file.

              curl recognizes the environment variable named ’CURL_CA_BUNDLE’ if it is set, and  uses  the  given
              path as a path to a CA cert bundle. This option overrides that variable.

              The windows version of curl will automatically look for a CA certs file named 'curl‐ca‐bundle.crt’,
              either  in  the  same  directory as curl.exe, or in the Current Working Directory, or in any folder
              along your PATH.

              If curl is built against the NSS SSL library, the NSS PEM PKCS#11 module (libnsspem.so) needs to be
              available for this option to work properly.

              (iOS and macOS only) If curl is built against Secure Transport, then this option is  supported  for
              backward  compatibility with other SSL engines, but it should not be set. If the option is not set,
              then curl will use the certificates in the system and user Keychain to verify the  peer,  which  is
              the preferred method of verifying the peer’s certificate chain.

              (Schannel  only)  This  option is supported for Schannel in Windows 7 or later with libcurl 7.60 or
              later. This option is supported for backward compatibility with other SSL engines;  instead  it  is
              recommended to use Windows’ store of root certificates (the default for Schannel).

              If [4m--cacert[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐cacert CA‐file.txt https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐capath[24m and [4m‐k,[24m [4m‐‐insecure[24m.

       --capath <dir>
              (TLS)  Tells curl to use the specified certificate directory to verify the peer. Multiple paths can
              be provided by separating them with ":" (e.g.  "path1:path2:path3"). The certificates  must  be  in
              PEM  format, and if curl is built against OpenSSL, the directory must have been processed using the
              c_rehash utility supplied with OpenSSL. Using [4m--capath[24m can allow OpenSSL‐powered curl to make  SSL‐
              connections  much  more  efficiently than using [4m--cacert[24m if the [4m--cacert[24m file contains many CA cer‐
              tificates.

              If this option is set, the default capath value will be ignored.

              If [4m--capath[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐capath /local/directory https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐cacert[24m and [4m‐k,[24m [4m‐‐insecure[24m.

       --cert‐status
              (TLS) Tells curl to verify the status of the server certificate by using the Certificate Status Re‐
              quest (aka. OCSP stapling) TLS extension.

              If this option is enabled and the server sends an invalid (e.g. expired) response, if the  response
              suggests that the server certificate has been revoked, or no response at all is received, the veri‐
              fication fails.

              This is currently only implemented in the OpenSSL, GnuTLS and NSS backends.

              Providing  [4m--cert‐status[24m  multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it again with --no‐cert‐sta‐
              tus.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐cert‐status https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐pinnedpubkey[24m. Added in 7.41.0.

       --cert‐type <type>
              (TLS) Tells curl what type the provided client certificate is using. PEM, DER, ENG and P12 are rec‐
              ognized types.

              The default type depends on the TLS backend and is usually PEM, however for  Secure  Transport  and
              Schannel it is P12. If [4m-E,[24m [4m--cert[24m is a pkcs11: URI then ENG is the default type.

              If [4m--cert‐type[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐cert‐type PEM ‐‐cert file https://example.com

              See also [4m‐E,[24m [4m‐‐cert[24m, [4m‐‐key[24m and [4m‐‐key‐type[24m.

       -E, --cert <certificate[:password]>
              (TLS)  Tells curl to use the specified client certificate file when getting a file with HTTPS, FTPS
              or another SSL‐based protocol. The certificate must be in PKCS#12 format if using Secure Transport,
              or PEM format if using any other engine. If the optional password is  not  specified,  it  will  be
              queried  for  on the terminal. Note that this option assumes a certificate file that is the private
              key and the client certificate concatenated. See [4m-E,[24m [4m--cert[24m and  [4m--key[24m  to  specify  them  indepen‐
              dently.

              In  the <certificate> portion of the argument, you must escape the character ":" as "\:" so that it
              is not recognized as the password delimiter. Similarly, you must escape the character "\"  as  "\\"
              so that it is not recognized as an escape character.

              If  curl  is  built  against the NSS SSL library then this option can tell curl the nickname of the
              certificate to use within the NSS database defined by the environment variable SSL_DIR (or  by  de‐
              fault /etc/pki/nssdb). If the NSS PEM PKCS#11 module (libnsspem.so) is available then PEM files may
              be loaded.

              If  you provide a path relative to the current directory, you must prefix the path with "./" in or‐
              der to avoid confusion with an NSS database nickname.

              If curl is built against OpenSSL library, and the engine pkcs11 is available, then  a  PKCS#11  URI
              (RFC  7512)  can  be  used to specify a certificate located in a PKCS#11 device. A string beginning
              with "pkcs11:" will be interpreted as a PKCS#11 URI. If a PKCS#11 URI is provided, then  the  [4m--en‐[0m
              [4mgine[24m  option will be set as "pkcs11" if none was provided and the [4m--cert‐type[24m option will be set as
              "ENG" if none was provided.

              (iOS and macOS only) If curl is built against Secure Transport, then the certificate string can ei‐
              ther be the name of a certificate/private key in the system or user keychain,  or  the  path  to  a
              PKCS#12‐encoded  certificate and private key. If you want to use a file from the current directory,
              please precede it with "./" prefix, in order to avoid confusion with a nickname.

              (Schannel only) Client certificates must be specified by a path expression to a certificate  store.
              (Loading  PFX  is  not  supported;  you  can import it to a store first). You can use "<store loca‐
              tion>\<store name>\<thumbprint>" to refer to a certificate in the system  certificates  store,  for
              example,  "CurrentUser\MY\934a7ac6f8a5d579285a74fa61e19f23ddfe8d7a".  Thumbprint is usually a SHA‐1
              hex string which you can see in certificate details. Following store locations are supported:  Cur‐
              rentUser,  LocalMachine, CurrentService, Services, CurrentUserGroupPolicy, LocalMachineGroupPolicy,
              LocalMachineEnterprise.

              If [4m-E,[24m [4m--cert[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐cert certfile ‐‐key keyfile https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐cert‐type[24m, [4m‐‐key[24m and [4m‐‐key‐type[24m.

       --ciphers <list of ciphers>
              (TLS) Specifies which ciphers to use in the connection. The list of ciphers must specify valid  ci‐
              phers. Read up on SSL cipher list details on this URL:

              https://curl.se/docs/ssl‐ciphers.html

              If [4m--ciphers[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐ciphers ECDHE‐ECDSA‐AES256‐CCM8 https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐tlsv1.3[24m, [4m‐‐tls13‐ciphers[24m and [4m‐‐proxy‐ciphers[24m.

       --compressed‐ssh
              (SCP  SFTP)  Enables  built‐in SSH compression.  This is a request, not an order; the server may or
              may not do it.

              Providing [4m--compressed‐ssh[24m multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable  it  again  with  --no‐com‐
              pressed‐ssh.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐compressed‐ssh sftp://example.com/

              See also [4m‐‐compressed[24m. Added in 7.56.0.

       --compressed
              (HTTP)  Request  a compressed response using one of the algorithms curl supports, and automatically
              decompress the content.

              Response headers are not modified when saved, so if they are "interpreted" separately  again  at  a
              later point they might appear to be saying that the content is (still) compressed; while in fact it
              has already been decompressed.

              If  this  option  is  used and the server sends an unsupported encoding, curl will report an error.
              This is a request, not an order; the server may or may not deliver data compressed.

              Providing [4m--compressed[24m multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it again with --no‐compressed.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐compressed https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐compressed‐ssh[24m.

       -K, --config <file>
              Specify a text file to read curl arguments from. The command line arguments found in the text  file
              will be used as if they were provided on the command line.

              Options  and  their  parameters must be specified on the same line in the file, separated by white‐
              space, colon, or the equals sign. Long option names can optionally be  given  in  the  config  file
              without  the initial double dashes and if so, the colon or equals characters can be used as separa‐
              tors. If the option is specified with one or two dashes, there can be no colon or equals  character
              between the option and its parameter.

              If the parameter contains whitespace (or starts with : or =), the parameter must be enclosed within
              quotes.  Within double quotes, the following escape sequences are available: \\, \", \t, \n, \r and
              \v. A backslash preceding any other letter is ignored.

              If the first column of a config line is a ’#’ character, the rest of the line will be treated as  a
              comment.

              Only write one option per physical line in the config file. A single line is required to be no more
              than 10 megabytes (since 8.2.0).

              Specify the filename to [4m-K,[24m [4m--config[24m as ’‐’ to make curl read the file from stdin.

              Note  that  to  be able to specify a URL in the config file, you need to specify it using the [4m--url[0m
              option, and not by simply writing the URL on its own line. So, it could look similar to this:

              url = "https://curl.se/docs/"

               # --- Example file ---
               # this is a comment
               url = "example.com"
               output = "curlhere.html"
               user‐agent = "superagent/1.0"

               # and fetch another URL too
               url = "example.com/docs/manpage.html"
               -O
               referer = "http://nowhereatall.example.com/"
               # --- End of example file ---

              When curl is invoked, it (unless [4m-q,[24m [4m--disable[24m is used) checks for a default config file  and  uses
              it  if found, even when [4m-K,[24m [4m--config[24m is used. The default config file is checked for in the follow‐
              ing places in this order:

              1) "$CURL_HOME/.curlrc"

              2) "$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/curlrc" (Added in 7.73.0)

              3) "$HOME/.curlrc"

              4) Windows: "%USERPROFILE%\.curlrc"

              5) Windows: "%APPDATA%\.curlrc"

              6) Windows: "%USERPROFILE%\Application Data\.curlrc"

              7) Non‐Windows: use getpwuid to find the home directory

              8) On Windows, if it finds no .curlrc file in the sequence described above, it checks  for  one  in
              the same dir the curl executable is placed.

              On  Windows  two  filenames  are  checked per location: .curlrc and _curlrc, preferring the former.
              Older versions on Windows checked for _curlrc only.

              [4m-K,[24m [4m--config[24m can be used several times in a command line

              Example:
               curl ‐‐config file.txt https://example.com

              See also [4m‐q,[24m [4m‐‐disable[24m.

       --connect‐timeout <fractional seconds>
              Maximum time in seconds that you allow curl’s connection to take.  This only limits the  connection
              phase,  so  if curl connects within the given period it will continue - if not it will exit.  Since
              version 7.32.0, this option accepts decimal values.

              The "connection phase" is considered complete when the DNS lookup and requested TCP,  TLS  or  QUIC
              handshakes are done.

              The  decimal  value  needs to provided using a dot (.) as decimal separator - not the local version
              even if it might be using another separator.

              If [4m--connect‐timeout[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Examples:
               curl ‐‐connect‐timeout 20 https://example.com
               curl ‐‐connect‐timeout 3.14 https://example.com

              See also [4m‐m,[24m [4m‐‐max‐time[24m.

       --connect‐to <HOST1:PORT1:HOST2:PORT2>

              For a request to the given HOST1:PORT1 pair, connect to HOST2:PORT2 instead.  This option is  suit‐
              able  to  direct  requests  at  a  specific server, e.g. at a specific cluster node in a cluster of
              servers. This option is only used to establish the network connection. It does NOT affect the host‐
              name/port that is used for TLS/SSL (e.g. SNI, certificate verification) or for the application pro‐
              tocols. "HOST1" and "PORT1" may be the empty string, meaning "any host/port". "HOST2"  and  "PORT2"
              may also be the empty string, meaning "use the request’s original host/port".

              A  "host"  specified  to this option is compared as a string, so it needs to match the name used in
              request URL. It can be either numerical such as "127.0.0.1" or the full host name  such  as  "exam‐
              ple.org".

              [4m--connect‐to[24m can be used several times in a command line

              Example:
               curl ‐‐connect‐to example.com:443:example.net:8443 https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐resolve[24m and [4m‐H,[24m [4m‐‐header[24m. Added in 7.49.0.

       -C, --continue‐at <offset>
              Continue/Resume  a previous file transfer at the given offset. The given offset is the exact number
              of bytes that will be skipped, counting from the beginning of the source file before it  is  trans‐
              ferred  to  the  destination. If used with uploads, the FTP server command SIZE will not be used by
              curl.

              Use "‐C -" to tell curl to automatically find out where/how to resume the transfer.  It  then  uses
              the given output/input files to figure that out.

              If [4m-C,[24m [4m--continue‐at[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Examples:
               curl ‐C ‐ https://example.com
               curl ‐C 400 https://example.com

              See also [4m‐r,[24m [4m‐‐range[24m.

       -c, --cookie‐jar <filename>
              (HTTP)  Specify  to which file you want curl to write all cookies after a completed operation. Curl
              writes all cookies from its in‐memory cookie storage to the given file at the end of operations. If
              no cookies are known, no data will be written. The file will be written using the  Netscape  cookie
              file format. If you set the file name to a single dash, "‐", the cookies will be written to stdout.

              This  command  line  option will activate the cookie engine that makes curl record and use cookies.
              Another way to activate it is to use the [4m-b,[24m [4m--cookie[24m option.

              If the cookie jar cannot be created or written to, the whole curl operation will not fail  or  even
              report  an  error  clearly.  Using [4m-v,[24m [4m--verbose[24m will get a warning displayed, but that is the only
              visible feedback you get about this possibly lethal situation.

              If [4m-c,[24m [4m--cookie‐jar[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Examples:
               curl ‐c store‐here.txt https://example.com
               curl ‐c store‐here.txt ‐b read‐these https://example.com

              See also [4m‐b,[24m [4m‐‐cookie[24m.

       -b, --cookie <data|filename>
              (HTTP) Pass the data to the HTTP server in the Cookie header. It is supposedly the data  previously
              received  from  the server in a "Set‐Cookie:" line. The data should be in the format "NAME1=VALUE1;
              NAME2=VALUE2". This makes curl use the cookie header with this content explicitly in  all  outgoing
              request(s).  If  multiple  requests  are done due to authentication, followed redirects or similar,
              they will all get this cookie passed on.

              If no ’=’ symbol is used in the argument, it is instead treated as a filename  to  read  previously
              stored cookie from. This option also activates the cookie engine which will make curl record incom‐
              ing cookies, which may be handy if you are using this in combination with the [4m-L,[24m [4m--location[24m option
              or  do  multiple  URL transfers on the same invoke. If the file name is exactly a minus ("‐"), curl
              will instead read the contents from stdin.

              The file format of the file to read cookies from should be plain HTTP headers (Set‐Cookie style) or
              the Netscape/Mozilla cookie file format.

              The file specified with [4m-b,[24m [4m--cookie[24m is only used as input. No cookies will be written to the file.
              To store cookies, use the [4m-c,[24m [4m--cookie‐jar[24m option.

              If you use the Set‐Cookie file format and do not specify a domain then the cookie is not sent since
              the domain will never match. To address this, set a domain in Set‐Cookie line (doing that will  in‐
              clude sub‐domains) or preferably: use the Netscape format.

              Users  often want to both read cookies from a file and write updated cookies back to a file, so us‐
              ing both [4m-b,[24m [4m--cookie[24m and [4m-c,[24m [4m--cookie‐jar[24m in the same command line is common.

              [4m-b,[24m [4m--cookie[24m can be used several times in a command line

              Examples:
               curl ‐b cookiefile https://example.com
               curl ‐b cookiefile ‐c cookiefile https://example.com

              See also [4m‐c,[24m [4m‐‐cookie‐jar[24m and [4m‐j,[24m [4m‐‐junk‐session‐cookies[24m.

       --create‐dirs
              When used in conjunction with the [4m-o,[24m [4m--output[24m option, curl will create the necessary local  direc‐
              tory  hierarchy  as needed. This option creates the directories mentioned with the [4m-o,[24m [4m--output[24m op‐
              tion, nothing else. If the [4m-o,[24m [4m--output[24m file name uses no directory, or if the directories it  men‐
              tions already exist, no directories will be created.

              Created dirs are made with mode 0750 on unix style file systems.

              To create remote directories when using FTP or SFTP, try [4m--ftp‐create‐dirs[24m.

              Providing  [4m--create‐dirs[24m  multiple  times  has no extra effect.  Disable it again with --no‐create‐
              dirs.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐create‐dirs ‐‐output local/dir/file https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐ftp‐create‐dirs[24m and [4m‐‐output‐dir[24m.

       --create‐file‐mode <mode>
              (SFTP SCP FILE) When curl is used to create files remotely using one of  the  supported  protocols,
              this option allows the user to set which ’mode’ to set on the file at creation time, instead of the
              default 0644.

              This option takes an octal number as argument.

              If [4m--create‐file‐mode[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐create‐file‐mode 0777 ‐T localfile sftp://example.com/new

              See also [4m‐‐ftp‐create‐dirs[24m. Added in 7.75.0.

       --crlf (FTP SMTP) Convert LF to CRLF in upload. Useful for MVS (OS/390).

              (SMTP added in 7.40.0)

              Providing [4m--crlf[24m multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it again with --no‐crlf.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐crlf ‐T file ftp://example.com/

              See also [4m‐B,[24m [4m‐‐use‐ascii[24m.

       --crlfile <file>
              (TLS) Provide a file using PEM format with a Certificate Revocation List that may specify peer cer‐
              tificates that are to be considered revoked.

              If [4m--crlfile[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐crlfile rejects.txt https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐cacert[24m and [4m‐‐capath[24m.

       --curves <algorithm list>
              (TLS)  Tells  curl  to request specific curves to use during SSL session establishment according to
              RFC  8422,  5.1.   Multiple  algorithms  can  be  provided  by  separating  them  with  ":"   (e.g.
              "X25519:P‐521").   The parameter is available identically in the "openssl s_client/s_server" utili‐
              ties.

              [4m--curves[24m allows a OpenSSL powered curl to make SSL‐connections with  exactly  the  (EC)  curve  re‐
              quested by the client, avoiding nontransparent client/server negotiations.

              If this option is set, the default curves list built into openssl will be ignored.

              If [4m--curves[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐curves X25519 https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐ciphers[24m. Added in 7.73.0.

       --data‐ascii <data>
              (HTTP) This is just an alias for [4m-d,[24m [4m--data[24m.

              [4m--data‐ascii[24m can be used several times in a command line

              Example:
               curl ‐‐data‐ascii @file https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐data‐binary[24m, [4m‐‐data‐raw[24m and [4m‐‐data‐urlencode[24m.

       --data‐binary <data>
              (HTTP) This posts data exactly as specified with no extra processing whatsoever.

              If you start the data with the letter @, the rest should be a filename. Data is posted in a similar
              manner  as [4m-d,[24m [4m--data[24m does, except that newlines and carriage returns are preserved and conversions
              are never done.

              Like [4m-d,[24m [4m--data[24m the default content‐type sent to the server  is  application/x‐www‐form‐urlencoded.
              If you want the data to be treated as arbitrary binary data by the server then set the content‐type
              to octet‐stream: -H "Content‐Type: application/octet‐stream".

              If this option is used several times, the ones following the first will append data as described in
              [4m-d,[24m [4m--data[24m.

              [4m--data‐binary[24m can be used several times in a command line

              Example:
               curl ‐‐data‐binary @filename https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐data‐ascii[24m.

       --data‐raw <data>
              (HTTP)  This  posts  data  similarly  to [4m-d,[24m [4m--data[24m but without the special interpretation of the @
              character.

              [4m--data‐raw[24m can be used several times in a command line

              Examples:
               curl ‐‐data‐raw "hello" https://example.com
               curl ‐‐data‐raw "@at@at@" https://example.com

              See also [4m‐d,[24m [4m‐‐data[24m. Added in 7.43.0.

       --data‐urlencode <data>
              (HTTP) This posts data, similar to the other [4m-d,[24m [4m--data[24m options with the exception that  this  per‐
              forms URL‐encoding.

              To be CGI‐compliant, the <data> part should begin with a [4mname[24m followed by a separator and a content
              specification. The <data> part can be passed to curl using one of the following syntaxes:

              content
                     This  will  make  curl  URL‐encode the content and pass that on. Just be careful so that the
                     content does not contain any = or @ symbols, as that will then make the syntax match one  of
                     the other cases below!

              =content
                     This  will  make curl URL‐encode the content and pass that on. The preceding = symbol is not
                     included in the data.

              name=content
                     This will make curl URL‐encode the content part and pass that on. Note that the name part is
                     expected to be URL‐encoded already.

              @filename
                     This will make curl load data from the given file (including any newlines), URL‐encode  that
                     data and pass it on in the POST.

              name@filename
                     This  will make curl load data from the given file (including any newlines), URL‐encode that
                     data and pass it on in the POST. The name part gets an equal  sign  appended,  resulting  in
                     [4mname=urlencoded‐file‐content[24m. Note that the name is expected to be URL‐encoded already.

              [4m--data‐urlencode[24m can be used several times in a command line

              Examples:
               curl ‐‐data‐urlencode name=val https://example.com
               curl ‐‐data‐urlencode =encodethis https://example.com
               curl ‐‐data‐urlencode name@file https://example.com
               curl ‐‐data‐urlencode @fileonly https://example.com

              See also [4m‐d,[24m [4m‐‐data[24m and [4m‐‐data‐raw[24m.

       -d, --data <data>
              (HTTP  MQTT)  Sends the specified data in a POST request to the HTTP server, in the same way that a
              browser does when a user has filled in an HTML form and presses the submit button. This will  cause
              curl  to pass the data to the server using the content‐type application/x‐www‐form‐urlencoded. Com‐
              pare to [4m-F,[24m [4m--form[24m.

              [4m--data‐raw[24m is almost the same but does not have a special interpretation of  the  @  character.  To
              post  data  purely binary, you should instead use the [4m--data‐binary[24m option. To URL‐encode the value
              of a form field you may use [4m--data‐urlencode[24m.

              If any of these options is used more than once on the same command line, the data pieces  specified
              will be merged with a separating &‐symbol. Thus, using '‐d name=daniel -d skill=lousy’ would gener‐
              ate a post chunk that looks like 'name=daniel&skill=lousy’.

              If you start the data with the letter @, the rest should be a file name to read the data from, or -
              if you want curl to read the data from stdin. Posting data from a file named ’foobar’ would thus be
              done  with  [4m-d,[24m [4m--data[24m @foobar. When [4m-d,[24m [4m--data[24m is told to read from a file like that, carriage re‐
              turns and newlines will be stripped out. If you do not want the @ character to have a  special  in‐
              terpretation use [4m--data‐raw[24m instead.

              The  data  for this option is passed on to the server exactly as provided on the command line. curl
              will not convert it, change it or improve it. It is up to the user to provide the data in the  cor‐
              rect form.

              [4m-d,[24m [4m--data[24m can be used several times in a command line

              Examples:
               curl ‐d "name=curl" https://example.com
               curl ‐d "name=curl" ‐d "tool=cmdline" https://example.com
               curl ‐d @filename https://example.com

              [4m‐‐form[24m and [4m‐I,[24m [4m‐‐head[24m and [4m‐T,[24m [4m‐‐upload‐file[24m.

       --delegation <LEVEL>
              (GSS/kerberos) Set LEVEL to tell the server what it is allowed to delegate when it  comes  to  user
              credentials.

              none   Do not allow any delegation.

              policy Delegates  if  and  only  if  the OK‐AS‐DELEGATE flag is set in the Kerberos service ticket,
                     which is a matter of realm policy.

              always Unconditionally allow the server to delegate.

              If [4m--delegation[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐delegation "none" https://example.com

              See also [4m‐k,[24m [4m‐‐insecure[24m and [4m‐‐ssl[24m.

       --digest
              (HTTP) Enables HTTP Digest authentication. This is an authentication scheme that prevents the pass‐
              word from being sent over the wire in clear text. Use this  in  combination  with  the  normal  [4m-u,[0m
              [4m--user[24m option to set user name and password.

              Providing [4m--digest[24m multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it again with --no‐digest.

              Example:
               curl ‐u name:password ‐‐digest https://example.com

              See also [4m‐u,[24m [4m‐‐user[24m, [4m‐‐proxy‐digest[24m and [4m‐‐anyauth[24m. This option is mutually exclusive to [4m‐‐basic[24m and
              [4m‐‐ntlm[24m and [4m‐‐negotiate[24m.

       --disable‐eprt
              (FTP)  Tell  curl to disable the use of the EPRT and LPRT commands when doing active FTP transfers.
              Curl will normally always first attempt to use EPRT, then LPRT before using PORT, but with this op‐
              tion, it will use PORT right away. EPRT and LPRT are extensions to the original FTP  protocol,  and
              may  not  work  on  all servers, but they enable more functionality in a better way than the tradi‐
              tional PORT command.

              --eprt can be used to explicitly enable EPRT again and --no‐eprt is an alias for [4m--disable‐eprt[24m.

              If the server is accessed using IPv6, this option will have no effect as EPRT is necessary then.

              Disabling EPRT only changes the active behavior. If you want to switch to passive mode you need  to
              not use [4m-P,[24m [4m--ftp‐port[24m or force it with [4m--ftp‐pasv[24m.

              Providing  [4m--disable‐eprt[24m  multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it again with --no‐disable‐
              eprt.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐disable‐eprt ftp://example.com/

              See also [4m‐‐disable‐epsv[24m and [4m‐P,[24m [4m‐‐ftp‐port[24m.

       --disable‐epsv
              (FTP) Tell curl to disable the use of the EPSV command when doing passive FTP transfers. Curl  will
              normally  always first attempt to use EPSV before PASV, but with this option, it will not try using
              EPSV.

              --epsv can be used to explicitly enable EPSV again and --no‐epsv is an alias for [4m--disable‐epsv[24m.

              If the server is an IPv6 host, this option will have no effect as EPSV is necessary then.

              Disabling EPSV only changes the passive behavior. If you want to switch to active mode you need  to
              use [4m-P,[24m [4m--ftp‐port[24m.

              Providing  [4m--disable‐epsv[24m  multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it again with --no‐disable‐
              epsv.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐disable‐epsv ftp://example.com/

              See also [4m‐‐disable‐eprt[24m and [4m‐P,[24m [4m‐‐ftp‐port[24m.

       -q, --disable
              If used as the first parameter on the command line, the [4mcurlrc[24m config file will  not  be  read  and
              used. See the [4m-K,[24m [4m--config[24m for details on the default config file search path.

              Providing [4m-q,[24m [4m--disable[24m multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it again with --no‐disable.

              Example:
               curl ‐q https://example.com

              See also [4m‐K,[24m [4m‐‐config[24m.

       --disallow‐username‐in‐url
              (HTTP)  This tells curl to exit if passed a URL containing a username. This is probably most useful
              when the URL is being provided at runtime or similar.

              Providing [4m--disallow‐username‐in‐url[24m multiple times has no extra effect.   Disable  it  again  with
              --no‐disallow‐username‐in‐url.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐disallow‐username‐in‐url https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐proto[24m. Added in 7.61.0.

       --dns‐interface <interface>
              (DNS)  Tell curl to send outgoing DNS requests through <interface>. This option is a counterpart to
              [4m--interface[24m (which does not affect DNS). The supplied string must be an interface name (not an  ad‐
              dress).

              If [4m--dns‐interface[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐dns‐interface eth0 https://example.com

              See  also [4m‐‐dns‐ipv4‐addr[24m and [4m‐‐dns‐ipv6‐addr[24m. [4m‐‐dns‐interface[24m requires that the underlying libcurl
              was built to support c‐ares. Added in 7.33.0.

       --dns‐ipv4‐addr <address>
              (DNS) Tell curl to bind to <ip‐address> when making IPv4 DNS requests, so  that  the  DNS  requests
              originate from this address. The argument should be a single IPv4 address.

              If [4m--dns‐ipv4‐addr[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐dns‐ipv4‐addr 10.1.2.3 https://example.com

              See  also [4m‐‐dns‐interface[24m and [4m‐‐dns‐ipv6‐addr[24m. [4m‐‐dns‐ipv4‐addr[24m requires that the underlying libcurl
              was built to support c‐ares. Added in 7.33.0.

       --dns‐ipv6‐addr <address>
              (DNS) Tell curl to bind to <ip‐address> when making IPv6 DNS requests, so  that  the  DNS  requests
              originate from this address. The argument should be a single IPv6 address.

              If [4m--dns‐ipv6‐addr[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐dns‐ipv6‐addr 2a04:4e42::561 https://example.com

              See  also [4m‐‐dns‐interface[24m and [4m‐‐dns‐ipv4‐addr[24m. [4m‐‐dns‐ipv6‐addr[24m requires that the underlying libcurl
              was built to support c‐ares. Added in 7.33.0.

       --dns‐servers <addresses>
              Set the list of DNS servers to be used instead of the system default.  The  list  of  IP  addresses
              should  be separated with commas. Port numbers may also optionally be given as [4m:<port‐number>[24m after
              each IP address.

              If [4m--dns‐servers[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐dns‐servers 192.168.0.1,192.168.0.2 https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐dns‐interface[24m and [4m‐‐dns‐ipv4‐addr[24m. [4m‐‐dns‐servers[24m requires that  the  underlying  libcurl
              was built to support c‐ares. Added in 7.33.0.

       --doh‐cert‐status
              Same as [4m--cert‐status[24m but used for DoH (DNS‐over‐HTTPS).

              Providing  [4m--doh‐cert‐status[24m  multiple  times has no extra effect.  Disable it again with --no‐doh‐
              cert‐status.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐doh‐cert‐status ‐‐doh‐url https://doh.example https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐doh‐insecure[24m. Added in 7.76.0.

       --doh‐insecure
              Same as [4m-k,[24m [4m--insecure[24m but used for DoH (DNS‐over‐HTTPS).

              Providing [4m--doh‐insecure[24m multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it again with  --no‐doh‐inse‐
              cure.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐doh‐insecure ‐‐doh‐url https://doh.example https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐doh‐url[24m. Added in 7.76.0.

       --doh‐url <URL>
              Specifies  which  DNS‐over‐HTTPS (DoH) server to use to resolve hostnames, instead of using the de‐
              fault name resolver mechanism. The URL must be HTTPS.

              Some SSL options that you set for your transfer will apply to DoH since the name lookups take place
              over SSL. However, the certificate verification settings are not inherited and  can  be  controlled
              separately via [4m--doh‐insecure[24m and [4m--doh‐cert‐status[24m.

              This option is unset if an empty string "" is used as the URL. (Added in 7.85.0)

              If [4m--doh‐url[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐doh‐url https://doh.example https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐doh‐insecure[24m. Added in 7.62.0.

       -D, --dump‐header <filename>
              (HTTP  FTP)  Write the received protocol headers to the specified file. If no headers are received,
              the use of this option will create an empty file.

              When used in FTP, the FTP server response lines are considered being "headers" and thus  are  saved
              there.

              Having  multiple  transfers in one set of operations (i.e. the URLs in one [4m-:,[24m [4m--next[24m clause), will
              append them to the same file, separated by a blank line.

              If [4m-D,[24m [4m--dump‐header[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐dump‐header store.txt https://example.com

              See also [4m‐o,[24m [4m‐‐output[24m.

       --egd‐file <file>
              (TLS) Deprecated option. This option is ignored by curl since 7.84.0. Prior to that it only had  an
              effect on curl if built to use old versions of OpenSSL.

              Specify the path name to the Entropy Gathering Daemon socket. The socket is used to seed the random
              engine for SSL connections.

              If [4m--egd‐file[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐egd‐file /random/here https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐random‐file[24m.

       --engine <name>
              (TLS)  Select  the OpenSSL crypto engine to use for cipher operations. Use [4m--engine[24m list to print a
              list of build‐time supported engines. Note that not all (and possibly none) of the engines  may  be
              available at runtime.

              If [4m--engine[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐engine flavor https://example.com

              (HTTP)  This option makes a conditional HTTP request for the specific ETag read from the given file
              by sending a custom If‐None‐Match header using the stored ETag.

              For correct results, make sure that the specified file contains only a single line with the desired
              ETag. An empty file is parsed as an empty ETag.

              Use the option [4m--etag‐save[24m to first save the ETag from a response, and then use this option to com‐
              pare against the saved ETag in a subsequent request.

              If [4m--etag‐compare[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐etag‐compare etag.txt https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐etag‐save[24m and [4m‐z,[24m [4m‐‐time‐cond[24m. Added in 7.68.0.

       --etag‐save <file>
              (HTTP) This option saves an HTTP ETag to the specified file. An ETag is a caching  related  header,
              usually returned in a response.

              If no ETag is sent by the server, an empty file is created.

              If [4m--etag‐save[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐etag‐save storetag.txt https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐etag‐compare[24m. Added in 7.68.0.

       --expect100‐timeout <seconds>
              (HTTP)  Maximum  time  in seconds that you allow curl to wait for a 100‐continue response when curl
              emits an Expects: 100‐continue header in its request. By default curl will wait  one  second.  This
              option  accepts  decimal  values!  When curl stops waiting, it will continue as if the response has
              been received.

              The decimal value needs to provided using a dot (.) as decimal separator - not  the  local  version
              even if it might be using another separator.

              If [4m--expect100‐timeout[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐expect100‐timeout 2.5 ‐T file https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐connect‐timeout[24m. Added in 7.47.0.

       --fail‐early
              Fail and exit on the first detected transfer error.

              When  curl is used to do multiple transfers on the command line, it will attempt to operate on each
              given URL, one by one. By default, it will ignore errors if there are more URLs given and the  last
              URL’s  success  will  determine  the error code curl returns. So early failures will be "hidden" by
              subsequent successful transfers.

              Using this option, curl will instead return an error on the first transfer that fails,  independent
              of  the  amount of URLs that are given on the command line. This way, no transfer failures go unde‐
              tected by scripts and similar.

              This option does not imply [4m-f,[24m [4m--fail[24m, which causes transfers to fail due to the server’s HTTP sta‐
              tus code. You can combine the two options, however note [4m-f,[24m [4m--fail[24m is not global and  is  therefore
              contained by [4m-:,[24m [4m--next[24m.

              This option is global and does not need to be specified for each use of ‐‐next.

              Providing [4m--fail‐early[24m multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it again with --no‐fail‐early.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐fail‐early https://example.com https://two.example

              See also [4m‐f,[24m [4m‐‐fail[24m and [4m‐‐fail‐with‐body[24m. Added in 7.52.0.

       --fail‐with‐body
              (HTTP)  Return an error on server errors where the HTTP response code is 400 or greater). In normal
              cases when an HTTP server fails to deliver a document, it  returns  an  HTML  document  stating  so
              (which  often also describes why and more). This flag will still allow curl to output and save that
              content but also to return error 22.

              This is an alternative option to [4m-f,[24m [4m--fail[24m which makes curl fail for the  same  circumstances  but
              without saving the content.

              Providing  [4m--fail‐with‐body[24m  multiple  times has no extra effect.  Disable it again with --no‐fail‐
              with‐body.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐fail‐with‐body https://example.com

              See also [4m‐f,[24m [4m‐‐fail[24m. This option is mutually exclusive to [4m‐f,[24m [4m‐‐fail[24m. Added in 7.76.0.

       -f, --fail
              (HTTP) Fail fast with no output at all on server errors. This is useful to enable scripts and users
              to better deal with failed attempts. In normal cases when an HTTP server fails to deliver  a  docu‐
              ment,  it  returns an HTML document stating so (which often also describes why and more). This flag
              will prevent curl from outputting that and return error 22.

              This method is not fail‐safe and there are occasions where non‐successful response codes will  slip
              through, especially when authentication is involved (response codes 401 and 407).

              Providing [4m-f,[24m [4m--fail[24m multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it again with --no‐fail.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐fail https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐fail‐with‐body[24m. This option is mutually exclusive to [4m‐‐fail‐with‐body[24m.

       --false‐start
              (TLS)  Tells  curl  to  use false start during the TLS handshake. False start is a mode where a TLS
              client will start sending application data before verifying the  server’s  Finished  message,  thus
              saving a round trip when performing a full handshake.

              This  is  currently  only implemented in the NSS and Secure Transport (on iOS 7.0 or later, or OS X
              10.9 or later) backends.

              Providing [4m--false‐start[24m multiple times has no extra effect.   Disable  it  again  with  --no‐false‐
              start.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐false‐start https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐tcp‐fastopen[24m. Added in 7.42.0.

       --form‐escape
              (HTTP)  Tells curl to pass on names of multipart form fields and files using backslash‐escaping in‐
              stead of percent‐encoding.

              If [4m--form‐escape[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐form‐escape ‐F ’field\name=curl’ ‐F ’file=@load"this’ https://example.com

              See also [4m‐F,[24m [4m‐‐form[24m. Added in 7.81.0.

       --form‐string <name=string>
              (HTTP SMTP IMAP) Similar to [4m-F,[24m [4m--form[24m except that the value string for the named parameter is used
              literally. Leading ’@’ and ’<’ characters, and the ’;type=’ string in the  value  have  no  special
              meaning.  Use this in preference to [4m-F,[24m [4m--form[24m if there’s any possibility that the string value may
              accidentally trigger the '@’ or ’<’ features of [4m-F,[24m [4m--form[24m.

              [4m--form‐string[24m can be used several times in a command line

              Example:
               curl ‐‐form‐string "data" https://example.com

              See also [4m‐F,[24m [4m‐‐form[24m.

       -F, --form <name=content>
              (HTTP SMTP IMAP) For HTTP protocol family, this lets curl emulate a filled‐in form in which a  user
              has pressed the submit button. This causes curl to POST data using the Content‐Type multipart/form‐
              data according to RFC 2388.

              For SMTP and IMAP protocols, this is the means to compose a multipart mail message to transmit.

              This  enables  uploading  of binary files etc. To force the ’content’ part to be a file, prefix the
              file name with an @ sign. To just get the content part from a file, prefix the file name  with  the
              symbol  <. The difference between @ and < is then that @ makes a file get attached in the post as a
              file upload, while the < makes a text field and just get the contents for that text  field  from  a
              file.

              Tell curl to read content from stdin instead of a file by using - as filename. This goes for both @
              and < constructs. When stdin is used, the contents is buffered in memory first by curl to determine
              its size and allow a possible resend. Defining a part’s data from a named non‐regular file (such as
              a  named pipe or similar) is unfortunately not subject to buffering and will be effectively read at
              transmission time; since the full size is unknown before the transfer starts, such data is sent  as
              chunks by HTTP and rejected by IMAP.

              Example:  send  an  image to an HTTP server, where ’profile’ is the name of the form‐field to which
              the file portrait.jpg will be the input:

               curl -F profile=@portrait.jpg https://example.com/upload.cgi

              Example: send your name and shoe size in two text fields to the server:

               curl -F name=John -F shoesize=11 https://example.com/

              Example: send your essay in a text field to the server. Send it as a plain text field, but get  the
              contents for it from a local file:

               curl -F "story=<hugefile.txt" https://example.com/

              You can also tell curl what Content‐Type to use by using ’type=’, in a manner similar to:

               curl -F "web=@index.html;type=text/html" example.com

              or

               curl -F "name=daniel;type=text/foo" example.com

              You  can  also  explicitly  change  the name field of a file upload part by setting filename=, like
              this:

               curl -F "file=@localfile;filename=nameinpost" example.com

              If filename/path contains ’,’ or ’;’, it must be quoted by double‐quotes like:

               curl -F "file=@\"local,file\";filename=\"name;in;post\"" example.com

              or

               curl -F ’file=@"local,file";filename="name;in;post"’ example.com

              Note that if a filename/path is quoted by double‐quotes, any double‐quote or backslash  within  the
              filename must be escaped by backslash.

              Quoting must also be applied to non‐file data if it contains semicolons, leading/trailing spaces or
              leading double quotes:

               curl -F ’colors="red; green; blue";type=text/x‐myapp’ example.com

              You can add custom headers to the field by setting headers=, like

                curl -F "submit=OK;headers=\"X‐submit‐type: OK\"" example.com

              or

                curl -F "submit=OK;headers=@headerfile" example.com

              The  headers=  keyword  may appear more that once and above notes about quoting apply. When headers
              are read from a file, Empty lines and lines starting with ’#’ are comments and ignored; each header
              can be folded by splitting between two words and starting the continuation line with a  space;  em‐
              bedded carriage‐returns and trailing spaces are stripped.  Here is an example of a header file con‐
              tents:

                # This file contain two headers.
                X‐header‐1: this is a header

                # The following header is folded.
                X‐header‐2: this is
                 another header

              To support sending multipart mail messages, the syntax is extended as follows:
              - name can be omitted: the equal sign is the first character of the argument,
              -  if  data starts with ’(’, this signals to start a new multipart: it can be followed by a content
              type specification.
              - a multipart can be terminated with a ’=)’ argument.

              Example: the following command sends an SMTP mime email consisting in an inline part in two  alter‐
              native formats: plain text and HTML. It attaches a text file:

               curl -F ’=(;type=multipart/alternative’ \
                    -F ’=plain text message’ \
                    -F ’= <body>HTML message</body>;type=text/html’ \
                    -F ’=)’ -F ’=@textfile.txt’ ...  smtp://example.com

              Data  can  be  encoded for transfer using encoder=. Available encodings are [4mbinary[24m and [4m8bit[24m that do
              nothing else than adding the corresponding Content‐Transfer‐Encoding header, [4m7bit[24m that only rejects
              8‐bit characters with a transfer error, [4mquoted‐printable[24m and [4mbase64[24m that encodes data according  to
              the corresponding schemes, limiting lines length to 76 characters.

              Example: send multipart mail with a quoted‐printable text message and a base64 attached file:

               curl -F ’=text message;encoder=quoted‐printable’ \
                    -F ’=@localfile;encoder=base64’ ... smtp://example.com

              See further examples and details in the MANUAL.

              [4m-F,[24m [4m--form[24m can be used several times in a command line

              Example:
               curl ‐‐form "name=curl" ‐‐form "file=@loadthis" https://example.com

              See  also  [4m‐d,[24m  [4m‐‐data[24m,  [4m‐‐form‐string[24m  and [4m‐‐form‐escape[24m. This option is mutually exclusive to [4m‐d,[0m
              [4m‐‐data[24m and [4m‐I,[24m [4m‐‐head[24m and [4m‐T,[24m [4m‐‐upload‐file[24m.

       --ftp‐account <data>
              (FTP) When an FTP server asks for "account data" after user name and password  has  been  provided,
              this data is sent off using the ACCT command.

              If [4m--ftp‐account[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐ftp‐account "mr.robot" ftp://example.com/

              See also [4m‐u,[24m [4m‐‐user[24m.

       --ftp‐alternative‐to‐user <command>
              (FTP)  If authenticating with the USER and PASS commands fails, send this command.  When connecting
              to Tumbleweed’s Secure Transport server over FTPS using a client  certificate,  using  "SITE  AUTH"
              will tell the server to retrieve the username from the certificate.

              If [4m--ftp‐alternative‐to‐user[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐ftp‐alternative‐to‐user "U53r" ftp://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐ftp‐account[24m and [4m‐u,[24m [4m‐‐user[24m.

       --ftp‐create‐dirs
              (FTP  SFTP)  When  an  FTP  or  SFTP URL/operation uses a path that does not currently exist on the
              server, the standard behavior of curl is to fail. Using this option, curl will instead  attempt  to
              create missing directories.

              Providing  [4m--ftp‐create‐dirs[24m  multiple  times has no extra effect.  Disable it again with --no‐ftp‐
              create‐dirs.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐ftp‐create‐dirs ‐T file ftp://example.com/remote/path/file

              See also [4m‐‐create‐dirs[24m.

       --ftp‐method <method>
              (FTP) Control what method curl should use to reach a file on an FTP(S) server. The method  argument
              should be one of the following alternatives:

              multicwd
                     curl  does  a single CWD operation for each path part in the given URL. For deep hierarchies
                     this means many commands. This is how RFC 1738 says it should be done. This is  the  default
                     but the slowest behavior.

              nocwd  curl  does  no  CWD  at  all.  curl will do SIZE, RETR, STOR etc and give a full path to the
                     server for all these commands. This is the fastest behavior.

              singlecwd
                     curl does one CWD with the full target directory and then operates on  the  file  "normally"
                     (like  in  the  multicwd  case).  This is somewhat more standards compliant than ’nocwd’ but
                     without the full penalty of ’multicwd’.

              If [4m--ftp‐method[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Examples:
               curl ‐‐ftp‐method multicwd ftp://example.com/dir1/dir2/file
               curl ‐‐ftp‐method nocwd ftp://example.com/dir1/dir2/file
               curl ‐‐ftp‐method singlecwd ftp://example.com/dir1/dir2/file

              See also [4m‐l,[24m [4m‐‐list‐only[24m.

       --ftp‐pasv
              (FTP) Use passive mode for the data connection. Passive is the internal default behavior, but using
              this option can be used to override a previous [4m-P,[24m [4m--ftp‐port[24m option.

              Reversing an enforced passive really is not doable but you must then instead  enforce  the  correct
              [4m-P,[24m [4m--ftp‐port[24m again.

              Passive  mode  means that curl will try the EPSV command first and then PASV, unless [4m--disable‐epsv[0m
              is used.

              Providing [4m--ftp‐pasv[24m multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it again with --no‐ftp‐pasv.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐ftp‐pasv ftp://example.com/

              See also [4m‐‐disable‐epsv[24m.

       -P, --ftp‐port <address>
              (FTP) Reverses the default initiator/listener roles when connecting with  FTP.  This  option  makes
              curl  use active mode. curl then tells the server to connect back to the client’s specified address
              and port, while passive mode asks the server to setup an IP address and port for it to connect  to.
              <address> should be one of:

              interface
                     e.g. "eth0" to specify which interface’s IP address you want to use (Unix only)

              IP address
                     e.g. "192.168.10.1" to specify the exact IP address

              host name
                     e.g. "my.host.domain" to specify the machine

              ‐      make curl pick the same IP address that is already used for the control connection

              Disable  the  use  of  PORT with [4m--ftp‐pasv[24m. Disable the attempt to use the EPRT command instead of
              PORT by using [4m--disable‐eprt[24m. EPRT is really PORT++.

              You can also append ":[start]‐[end]" to the right of the address, to tell curl what TCP port  range
              to use. That means you specify a port range, from a lower to a higher number. A single number works
              as well, but do note that it increases the risk of failure since the port may not be available.

              If [4m-P,[24m [4m--ftp‐port[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Examples:
               curl ‐P ‐ ftp:/example.com
               curl ‐P eth0 ftp:/example.com
               curl ‐P 192.168.0.2 ftp:/example.com

       --ftp‐pret
              (FTP)  Tell curl to send a PRET command before PASV (and EPSV). Certain FTP servers, mainly drftpd,
              require this non‐standard command for directory listings as well as up and downloads in PASV mode.

              Providing [4m--ftp‐pret[24m multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it again with --no‐ftp‐pret.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐ftp‐pret ftp://example.com/

              See also [4m‐P,[24m [4m‐‐ftp‐port[24m and [4m‐‐ftp‐pasv[24m.

       --ftp‐skip‐pasv‐ip
              (FTP) Tell curl to not use the IP address the server suggests in its response to curl’s  PASV  com‐
              mand  when  curl  connects the data connection. Instead curl will re‐use the same IP address it al‐
              ready uses for the control connection.

              Since curl 7.74.0 this option is enabled by default.

              This option has no effect if PORT, EPRT or EPSV is used instead of PASV.

              Providing [4m--ftp‐skip‐pasv‐ip[24m multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it again  with  --no‐ftp‐
              skip‐pasv‐ip.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐ftp‐skip‐pasv‐ip ftp://example.com/

              See also [4m‐‐ftp‐pasv[24m.

       --ftp‐ssl‐ccc‐mode <active/passive>
              (FTP)  Sets the CCC mode. The passive mode will not initiate the shutdown, but instead wait for the
              server to do it, and will not reply to the shutdown from the server. The active mode initiates  the
              shutdown and waits for a reply from the server.

              Providing  [4m--ftp‐ssl‐ccc‐mode[24m  multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it again with --no‐ftp‐
              ssl‐ccc‐mode.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐ftp‐ssl‐ccc‐mode active ‐‐ftp‐ssl‐ccc ftps://example.com/

              See also [4m‐‐ftp‐ssl‐ccc[24m.

       --ftp‐ssl‐ccc
              (FTP) Use CCC (Clear Command Channel) Shuts down the SSL/TLS layer after authenticating.  The  rest
              of the control channel communication will be unencrypted. This allows NAT routers to follow the FTP
              transaction. The default mode is passive.

              Providing  [4m--ftp‐ssl‐ccc[24m  multiple  times has no extra effect.  Disable it again with --no‐ftp‐ssl‐
              ccc.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐ftp‐ssl‐ccc ftps://example.com/

              See also [4m‐‐ssl[24m and [4m‐‐ftp‐ssl‐ccc‐mode[24m.

       --ftp‐ssl‐control
              (FTP) Require SSL/TLS for the FTP login, clear for transfer.   Allows  secure  authentication,  but
              non‐encrypted  data  transfers  for  efficiency.  Fails the transfer if the server does not support
              SSL/TLS.

              Providing [4m--ftp‐ssl‐control[24m multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it  again  with  --no‐ftp‐
              ssl‐control.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐ftp‐ssl‐control ftp://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐ssl[24m.

       -G, --get
              When used, this option will make all data specified with [4m-d,[24m [4m--data[24m, [4m--data‐binary[24m or [4m--data‐urlen‐[0m
              [4mcode[24m  to  be  used in an HTTP GET request instead of the POST request that otherwise would be used.
              The data will be appended to the URL with a ’?’ separator.

              If used in combination with [4m-I,[24m [4m--head[24m, the POST data will instead be appended to the  URL  with  a
              HEAD request.

              Providing [4m-G,[24m [4m--get[24m multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it again with --no‐get.

              Examples:
               curl ‐‐get https://example.com
               curl ‐‐get ‐d "tool=curl" ‐d "age=old" https://example.com

       -g, --globoff
              This  option switches off the "URL globbing parser". When you set this option, you can specify URLs
              that contain the letters {}[] without having curl itself interpret them. Note  that  these  letters
              are not normal legal URL contents but they should be encoded according to the URI standard.

              Providing [4m-g,[24m [4m--globoff[24m multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it again with --no‐globoff.

              Example:
               curl ‐g "https://example.com/{[]}}}}"

              See also [4m‐K,[24m [4m‐‐config[24m and [4m‐q,[24m [4m‐‐disable[24m.

       --happy‐eyeballs‐timeout‐ms <milliseconds>
              Happy  Eyeballs  is an algorithm that attempts to connect to both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses for dual‐
              stack hosts, giving IPv6 a head‐start of the specified number of milliseconds. If the IPv6  address
              cannot  be  connected to within that time, then a connection attempt is made to the IPv4 address in
              parallel. The first connection to be established is the one that is used.

              The range of suggested useful values is limited. Happy Eyeballs RFC 6555 says  "It  is  RECOMMENDED
              that  connection attempts be paced 150‐250 ms apart to balance human factors against network load."
              libcurl currently defaults to 200 ms. Firefox and Chrome currently default to 300 ms.

              If [4m--happy‐eyeballs‐timeout‐ms[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐happy‐eyeballs‐timeout‐ms 500 https://example.com

              See also [4m‐m,[24m [4m‐‐max‐time[24m and [4m‐‐connect‐timeout[24m. Added in 7.59.0.

       --haproxy‐clientip
              (HTTP) Sets a client IP in HAProxy PROXY protocol v1 header at the beginning of the connection.

              For valid requests, IPv4 addresses must be indicated as a series of exactly 4 integers in the range
              [0..255] inclusive written in decimal representation separated by  exactly  one  dot  between  each
              other.  Heading  zeroes are not permitted in front of numbers in order to avoid any possible confu‐
              sion with octal numbers. IPv6 addresses must be indicated as series of 4 hexadecimal digits  (upper
              or  lower case) delimited by colons between each other, with the acceptance of one double colon se‐
              quence to replace the largest acceptable range of consecutive zeroes. The total number  of  decoded
              bits must exactly be 128.

              Otherwise, any string can be accepted for the client IP and will be sent.

              It replaces ‘[4m--haproxy‐protocol[24m‘ if used, it is not necessary to specify both flags.

              This  option  is  primarily useful when sending test requests to verify a service is working as in‐
              tended.

              If [4m--haproxy‐clientip[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐haproxy‐clientip $IP

              See also [4m‐x,[24m [4m‐‐proxy[24m. Added in 8.2.0.

       --haproxy‐protocol
              (HTTP) Send a HAProxy PROXY protocol v1 header at the beginning of the connection. This is used  by
              some load balancers and reverse proxies to indicate the client’s true IP address and port.

              This option is primarily useful when sending test requests to a service that expects this header.

              Providing  [4m--haproxy‐protocol[24m  multiple  times  has  no  extra effect.  Disable it again with --no‐
              haproxy‐protocol.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐haproxy‐protocol https://example.com

              See also [4m‐x,[24m [4m‐‐proxy[24m. Added in 7.60.0.

       -I, --head
              (HTTP FTP FILE) Fetch the headers only! HTTP‐servers feature the command HEAD which  this  uses  to
              get  nothing but the header of a document. When used on an FTP or FILE file, curl displays the file
              size and last modification time only.

              Providing [4m-I,[24m [4m--head[24m multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it again with --no‐head.

              Example:
               curl ‐I https://example.com

              See also [4m‐G,[24m [4m‐‐get[24m, [4m‐v,[24m [4m‐‐verbose[24m and [4m‐‐trace‐ascii[24m.

       -H, --header <header/@file>
              (HTTP IMAP SMTP) Extra header to include in information sent. When used within an HTTP request,  it
              is added to the regular request headers.

              For  an  IMAP  or SMTP MIME uploaded mail built with [4m-F,[24m [4m--form[24m options, it is prepended to the re‐
              sulting MIME document, effectively including it at the mail global level. It does  not  affect  raw
              uploaded mails (Added in 7.56.0).

              You  may  specify any number of extra headers. Note that if you should add a custom header that has
              the same name as one of the internal ones curl would use, your externally set header will  be  used
              instead  of the internal one.  This allows you to make even trickier stuff than curl would normally
              do. You should not replace internally set headers without knowing perfectly well what you  are  do‐
              ing.  Remove  an  internal  header by giving a replacement without content on the right side of the
              colon, as in: -H "Host:". If you send the custom header with no‐value then its header must be  ter‐
              minated with a semicolon, such as -H "X‐Custom‐Header;" to send "X‐Custom‐Header:".

              curl  will  make  sure that each header you add/replace is sent with the proper end‐of‐line marker,
              you should thus [1mnot [22madd that as a part of the header content: do not add newlines or  carriage  re‐
              turns, they will only mess things up for you.

              This  option can take an argument in @filename style, which then adds a header for each line in the
              input file. Using @‐ will make curl read the header file from stdin. Added in 7.55.0.

              Please note that most anti‐spam utilities check the presence and value of several MIME  mail  head‐
              ers:  these  are  "From:", "To:", "Date:" and "Subject:" among others and should be added with this
              option.

              You need [4m--proxy‐header[24m to send custom headers intended for an HTTP proxy. Added in 7.37.0.

              Passing on a "Transfer‐Encoding: chunked" header when doing an HTTP request with  a  request  body,
              will make curl send the data using chunked encoding.

              [1mWARNING[22m:  headers  set with this option will be set in all HTTP requests - even after redirects are
              followed, like when told with [4m-L,[24m [4m--location[24m. This can lead to the header being sent to other hosts
              than the original host, so sensitive headers should be used with caution  combined  with  following
              redirects.

              [4m-H,[24m [4m--header[24m can be used several times in a command line

              Examples:
               curl ‐H "X‐First‐Name: Joe" https://example.com
               curl ‐H "User‐Agent: yes‐please/2000" https://example.com
               curl ‐H "Host:" https://example.com
               curl ‐H @headers.txt https://example.com

       -h, --help <category>
              Usage  help.  This lists all commands of the <category>.  If no arg was provided, curl will display
              the most important command line arguments.  If the argument "all" was provided, curl  will  display
              all  options  available.  If the argument "category" was provided, curl will display all categories
              and their meanings.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐help all

              See also [4m‐v,[24m [4m‐‐verbose[24m.

       --hostpubmd5 <md5>
              (SFTP SCP) Pass a string containing 32 hexadecimal digits. The string should be  the  128  bit  MD5
              checksum  of the remote host’s public key, curl will refuse the connection with the host unless the
              md5sums match.

              If [4m--hostpubmd5[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐hostpubmd5 e5c1c49020640a5ab0f2034854c321a8 sftp://example.com/

              See also [4m‐‐hostpubsha256[24m.

       --hostpubsha256 <sha256>
              (SFTP SCP) Pass a string containing a Base64‐encoded SHA256 hash of the remote host’s  public  key.
              Curl will refuse the connection with the host unless the hashes match.

              This feature requires libcurl to be built with libssh2 and does not work with other SSH backends.

              If [4m--hostpubsha256[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐hostpubsha256 NDVkMTQxMGQ1ODdmMjQ3MjczYjAyOTY5MmRkMjVmNDQ= sftp://example.com/

              See also [4m‐‐hostpubmd5[24m. Added in 7.80.0.

       --hsts <file name>
              (HTTPS)  This  option  enables  HSTS  for the transfer. If the file name points to an existing HSTS
              cache file, that will be used. After a completed transfer, the cache will be saved to the file name
              again if it has been modified.

              If curl is told to use HTTP:// for a transfer involving a host name that exists in the HSTS  cache,
              it  upgrades  the  transfer  to  use HTTPS. Each HSTS cache entry has an individual life time after
              which the upgrade is no longer performed.

              Specify a "" file name (zero length) to avoid loading/saving and make curl just handle HSTS in mem‐
              ory.

              If this option is used several times, curl will load contents from all the files but the  last  one
              will be used for saving.

              [4m--hsts[24m can be used several times in a command line

              Example:
               curl ‐‐hsts cache.txt https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐proto[24m. Added in 7.74.0.

       --http0.9
              (HTTP) Tells curl to be fine with HTTP version 0.9 response.

              HTTP/0.9  is  a completely headerless response and therefore you can also connect with this to non‐
              HTTP servers and still get a response since curl will simply transparently downgrade - if allowed.

              Since curl 7.66.0, HTTP/0.9 is disabled by default.

              Providing [4m--http0.9[24m multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it again with --no‐http0.9.

       -0, --http1.0
              (HTTP) Tells curl to use HTTP version 1.0 instead of using its internally preferred HTTP version.

              Providing [4m-0,[24m [4m--http1.0[24m multiple times has no extra effect.

       --http1.1
              (HTTP) Tells curl to use HTTP version 1.1.

              Providing [4m--http1.1[24m multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐http1.1 https://example.com

              See  also  [4m‐0,[24m  [4m‐‐http1.0[24m  and  [4m‐‐http0.9[24m.  This  option is mutually exclusive to [4m‐0,[24m [4m‐‐http1.0[24m and

       --http2‐prior‐knowledge
              (HTTP) Tells curl to issue its non‐TLS HTTP requests using HTTP/2 without HTTP/1.1 Upgrade. It  re‐
              quires  prior knowledge that the server supports HTTP/2 straight away. HTTPS requests will still do
              HTTP/2 the standard way with negotiated protocol version in the TLS handshake.

              Providing [4m--http2‐prior‐knowledge[24m multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it again with  --no‐
              http2‐prior‐knowledge.

              Example:

              built to support HTTP/2. This option is mutually exclusive  to  [4m‐‐http1.1[24m  and  [4m‐0,[24m  [4m‐‐http1.0[24m  and
              [4m‐‐http2[24m and [4m‐‐http3[24m. Added in 7.49.0.

       --http2
              (HTTP) Tells curl to use HTTP version 2.

              For HTTPS, this means curl will attempt to negotiate HTTP/2 in the TLS handshake. curl does this by
              default.

              For  HTTP, this means curl will attempt to upgrade the request to HTTP/2 using the Upgrade: request
              header.

              When curl uses HTTP/2 over HTTPS, it does not itself insist on TLS 1.2 or higher even  though  that
              is required by the specification. A user can add this version requirement with [4m--tlsv1.2[24m.

              Providing [4m--http2[24m multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐http2 https://example.com

              to support  HTTP/2.  This  option  is  mutually  exclusive  to  [4m‐‐http1.1[24m  and  [4m‐0,[24m  [4m‐‐http1.0[24m  and
              [4m‐‐http2‐prior‐knowledge[24m and [4m‐‐http3[24m. Added in 7.33.0.

       --http3‐only
              (HTTP) **WARNING**: this option is experimental. Do not use in production.

              Instructs  curl  to  use  HTTP/3 to the host in the URL, with no fallback to earlier HTTP versions.
              HTTP/3 can only be used for HTTPS and not for HTTP URLs. For HTTP, this option will trigger an  er‐
              ror.

              This  option  allows  a user to avoid using the Alt‐Svc method of upgrading to HTTP/3 when you know
              that the target speaks HTTP/3 on the given host and port.

              This option will make curl fail if a QUIC connection cannot be established, it will not attempt any
              other HTTP version on its own. Use [4m--http3[24m for similar functionality [4mwith[24m a fallback.

              Providing [4m--http3‐only[24m multiple times has no extra effect.

       --http3
              (HTTP) **WARNING**: this option is experimental. Do not use in production.

              Tells curl to try HTTP/3 to the host in the URL, but fallback  to  earlier  HTTP  versions  if  the
              HTTP/3 connection establishment fails. HTTP/3 is only available for HTTPS and not for HTTP URLs.

              This  option  allows  a user to avoid using the Alt‐Svc method of upgrading to HTTP/3 when you know
              that the target speaks HTTP/3 on the given host and port.

              When asked to use HTTP/3, curl will issue a separate attempt to use  older  HTTP  versions  with  a
              slight  delay, so if the HTTP/3 transfer fails or is very slow, curl will still try to proceed with
              an older HTTP version.

              Use [4m--http3‐only[24m for similar functionality [4mwithout[24m a fallback.

              Providing [4m--http3[24m multiple times has no extra effect.

       --ignore‐content‐length
              (FTP HTTP) For HTTP, Ignore the Content‐Length header. This is particularly useful for servers run‐
              ning Apache 1.x, which will report incorrect Content‐Length for files larger than 2 gigabytes.

              For FTP (since 7.46.0), skip the RETR command to figure out the size before downloading a file.

              This option does not work for HTTP if libcurl was built to use hyper.

              Providing [4m--ignore‐content‐length[24m multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it again with  --no‐
              ignore‐content‐length.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐ignore‐content‐length https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐ftp‐skip‐pasv‐ip[24m.

       -i, --include
              Include  the HTTP response headers in the output. The HTTP response headers can include things like
              server name, cookies, date of the document, HTTP version and more...

              To view the request headers, consider the [4m-v,[24m [4m--verbose[24m option.

              Providing [4m-i,[24m [4m--include[24m multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it again with --no‐include.

              Example:
               curl ‐i https://example.com

              See also [4m‐v,[24m [4m‐‐verbose[24m.

       -k, --insecure
              (TLS SFTP SCP) By default, every secure connection curl makes is verified to be secure  before  the
              transfer  takes place. This option makes curl skip the verification step and proceed without check‐
              ing.

              When this option is not used for protocols using TLS, curl verifies the  server’s  TLS  certificate
              before  it continues: that the certificate contains the right name which matches the host name used
              in the URL and that the certificate has been signed by a CA certificate present in the cert  store.
              See this online resource for further details:
               https://curl.se/docs/sslcerts.html

              For  SFTP and SCP, this option makes curl skip the [4mknown_hosts[24m verification.  [4mknown_hosts[24m is a file
              normally stored in the user’s home directory in the ".ssh" subdirectory, which contains host  names
              and their public keys.

              [1mWARNING[22m: using this option makes the transfer insecure.

              When  curl uses secure protocols it trusts responses and allows for example HSTS and Alt‐Svc infor‐
              mation to be stored and used subsequently. Using [4m-k,[24m [4m--insecure[24m can make curl trust  and  use  such
              information from malicious servers.

              Providing [4m-k,[24m [4m--insecure[24m multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it again with --no‐insecure.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐insecure https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐proxy‐insecure[24m, [4m‐‐cacert[24m and [4m‐‐capath[24m.

       --interface <name>
              Perform  an operation using a specified interface. You can enter interface name, IP address or host
              name. An example could look like:

               curl --interface eth0:1 https://www.example.com/

              On Linux it can be used to specify a VRF, but the binary needs to either have CAP_NET_RAW or to  be
              run  as  root.  More information about Linux VRF: https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/network‐
              ing/vrf.txt

              If [4m--interface[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐interface eth0 https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐dns‐interface[24m.

       -4, --ipv4
              This option tells curl to use IPv4 addresses only when resolving host names, and  not  for  example
              try IPv6.

              Providing [4m-4,[24m [4m--ipv4[24m multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐ipv4 https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐http1.1[24m and [4m‐‐http2[24m. This option is mutually exclusive to [4m‐6,[24m [4m‐‐ipv6[24m.

       -6, --ipv6
              This  option  tells  curl to use IPv6 addresses only when resolving host names, and not for example
              try IPv4.

              Providing [4m-6,[24m [4m--ipv6[24m multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐ipv6 https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐http1.1[24m and [4m‐‐http2[24m. This option is mutually exclusive to [4m‐4,[24m [4m‐‐ipv4[24m.

       --json <data>
              (HTTP) Sends the specified JSON data in a POST request to the HTTP server. [4m--json[24m works as a short‐
              cut for passing on these three options:

               --data [arg]
               --header "Content‐Type: application/json"
               --header "Accept: application/json"

              There is no verification that the passed in data is actual JSON or that the syntax is correct.

              If you start the data with the letter @, the rest should be a file name to read the data from, or a
              single dash (‐) if you want curl to read the data from stdin. Posting data from a file named  ’foo‐
              bar’ would thus be done with [4m--json[24m @foobar and to instead read the data from stdin, use [4m--json[24m @‐.

              If  this option is used more than once on the same command line, the additional data pieces will be
              concatenated to the previous before sending.

              The headers this option sets can be overridden with [4m-H,[24m [4m--header[24m as usual.

              [4m--json[24m can be used several times in a command line

              Examples:
               curl ‐‐json ’{ "drink": "coffe" }’ https://example.com
               curl ‐‐json ’{ "drink":’ ‐‐json ’ "coffe" }’ https://example.com
               curl ‐‐json @prepared https://example.com
               curl ‐‐json @‐ https://example.com < json.txt

              See also [4m‐‐data‐binary[24m and [4m‐‐data‐raw[24m. This option is mutually exclusive  to  [4m‐F,[24m  [4m‐‐form[24m  and  [4m‐I,[0m
              [4m‐‐head[24m and [4m‐T,[24m [4m‐‐upload‐file[24m. Added in 7.82.0.

       -j, --junk‐session‐cookies
              (HTTP)  When  curl  is told to read cookies from a given file, this option will make it discard all
              "session cookies". This will basically have the same effect as if a new session is started. Typical
              browsers always discard session cookies when they are closed down.

              Providing [4m-j,[24m [4m--junk‐session‐cookies[24m multiple times has no extra effect.   Disable  it  again  with
              --no‐junk‐session‐cookies.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐junk‐session‐cookies ‐b cookies.txt https://example.com

              See also [4m‐b,[24m [4m‐‐cookie[24m and [4m‐c,[24m [4m‐‐cookie‐jar[24m.

       --keepalive‐time <seconds>
              This option sets the time a connection needs to remain idle before sending keepalive probes and the
              time  between  individual keepalive probes. It is currently effective on operating systems offering
              the TCP_KEEPIDLE and TCP_KEEPINTVL socket options (meaning Linux,  recent  AIX,  HP‐UX  and  more).
              Keepalives  are  used by the TCP stack to detect broken networks on idle connections. The number of
              missed keepalive probes before declaring the connection down is OS dependent and is commonly  9  or
              10. This option has no effect if [4m--no‐keepalive[24m is used.

              If unspecified, the option defaults to 60 seconds.

              If [4m--keepalive‐time[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐keepalive‐time 20 https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐no‐keepalive[24m and [4m‐m,[24m [4m‐‐max‐time[24m.

       --key‐type <type>
              (TLS)  Private  key file type. Specify which type your [4m--key[24m provided private key is. DER, PEM, and
              ENG are supported. If not specified, PEM is assumed.

              If [4m--key‐type[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐key‐type DER ‐‐key here https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐key[24m.

       --key <key>
              (TLS SSH) Private key file name. Allows you to provide your private key in this separate file.  For
              SSH,   if   not   specified,  curl  tries  the  following  candidates  in  order:  '~/.ssh/id_rsa’,
              ’~/.ssh/id_dsa’, ’./id_rsa’, ’./id_dsa’.

              If curl is built against OpenSSL library, and the engine pkcs11 is available, then  a  PKCS#11  URI
              (RFC  7512)  can  be  used to specify a private key located in a PKCS#11 device. A string beginning
              with "pkcs11:" will be interpreted as a PKCS#11 URI. If a PKCS#11 URI is provided, then  the  [4m--en‐[0m
              [4mgine[24m  option  will be set as "pkcs11" if none was provided and the [4m--key‐type[24m option will be set as
              "ENG" if none was provided.

              If curl is built against Secure Transport or Schannel then this option is ignored for TLS protocols
              (HTTPS, etc). Those backends expect the private key to  be  already  present  in  the  keychain  or
              PKCS#12 file containing the certificate.

              If [4m--key[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐cert certificate ‐‐key here https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐key‐type[24m and [4m‐E,[24m [4m‐‐cert[24m.

       --krb <level>
              (FTP)  Enable  Kerberos  authentication  and  use.  The  level must be entered and should be one of
              ’clear’, ’safe’, ’confidential’, or ’private’. Should you use a level that is  not  one  of  these,
              ’private’ will instead be used.

              If [4m--krb[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐krb clear ftp://example.com/

              See  also  [4m‐‐delegation[24m  and [4m‐‐ssl[24m. [4m‐‐krb[24m requires that the underlying libcurl was built to support
              Kerberos.

       --libcurl <file>
              Append this option to any ordinary curl command line, and you will get libcurl‐using C source  code
              written to the file that does the equivalent of what your command‐line operation does!

              This option is global and does not need to be specified for each use of ‐‐next.

              If [4m--libcurl[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐libcurl client.c https://example.com

              See also [4m‐v,[24m [4m‐‐verbose[24m.

       --limit‐rate <speed>
              Specify  the maximum transfer rate you want curl to use - for both downloads and uploads. This fea‐
              ture is useful if you have a limited pipe and you would like your transfer not to use  your  entire
              bandwidth. To make it slower than it otherwise would be.

              The  given  speed  is  measured in bytes/second, unless a suffix is appended.  Appending ’k’ or ’K’
              will count the number as kilobytes, ’m’ or ’M’ makes it megabytes, while ’g’ or ’G’ makes it  giga‐
              bytes.  The suffixes (k, M, G, T, P) are 1024 based. For example 1k is 1024. Examples: 200K, 3m and
              1G.

              The rate limiting logic works on averaging the transfer speed to no more  than  the  set  threshold
              over a period of multiple seconds.

              If  you  also  use the [4m-Y,[24m [4m--speed‐limit[24m option, that option will take precedence and might cripple
              the rate‐limiting slightly, to help keeping the speed‐limit logic working.

              If [4m--limit‐rate[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Examples:
               curl ‐‐limit‐rate 100K https://example.com
               curl ‐‐limit‐rate 1000 https://example.com
               curl ‐‐limit‐rate 10M https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐rate[24m, [4m‐Y,[24m [4m‐‐speed‐limit[24m and [4m‐y,[24m [4m‐‐speed‐time[24m.

       -l, --list‐only
              (FTP POP3) (FTP) When listing an FTP directory, this switch forces a name‐only view. This is  espe‐
              cially  useful if the user wants to machine‐parse the contents of an FTP directory since the normal
              directory view does not use a standard look or format. When used like this, the  option  causes  an
              NLST command to be sent to the server instead of LIST.

              Note:  Some FTP servers list only files in their response to NLST; they do not include sub‐directo‐
              ries and symbolic links.

              (POP3) When retrieving a specific email from POP3, this switch forces a LIST  command  to  be  per‐
              formed instead of RETR. This is particularly useful if the user wants to see if a specific message‐
              id exists on the server and what size it is.

              Note:  When combined with [4m-X,[24m [4m--request[24m, this option can be used to send a UIDL command instead, so
              the user may use the email’s unique identifier rather than its message‐id to make the request.

              Providing [4m-l,[24m [4m--list‐only[24m multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable  it  again  with  --no‐list‐
              only.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐list‐only ftp://example.com/dir/

              See also [4m‐Q,[24m [4m‐‐quote[24m and [4m‐X,[24m [4m‐‐request[24m.

       --local‐port <num/range>
              Set  a  preferred  single  number  or  range (FROM‐TO) of local port numbers to use for the connec‐
              tion(s).  Note that port numbers by nature are a scarce resource that will be busy at times so set‐
              ting this range to something too narrow might cause unnecessary connection setup failures.

              If [4m--local‐port[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐local‐port 1000‐3000 https://example.com

              See also [4m‐g,[24m [4m‐‐globoff[24m.

       --location‐trusted
              (HTTP) Like [4m-L,[24m [4m--location[24m, but will allow sending the name + password to all hosts that  the  site
              may  redirect  to.  This  may or may not introduce a security breach if the site redirects you to a
              site to which you will send your authentication info (which is plaintext in the case of HTTP  Basic
              authentication).

              Providing  [4m--location‐trusted[24m multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it again with --no‐loca‐
              tion‐trusted.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐location‐trusted ‐u user:password https://example.com

              See also [4m‐u,[24m [4m‐‐user[24m.

       -L, --location
              (HTTP) If the server reports that the requested page has moved to a different  location  (indicated
              with  a  Location:  header and a 3XX response code), this option will make curl redo the request on
              the new place. If used together with [4m-i,[24m [4m--include[24m or [4m-I,[24m [4m--head[24m, headers from all requested  pages
              will be shown. When authentication is used, curl only sends its credentials to the initial host. If
              a  redirect takes curl to a different host, it will not be able to intercept the user+password. See
              also [4m--location‐trusted[24m on how to change this. You can limit the amount of redirects to  follow  by
              using the [4m--max‐redirs[24m option.

              When  curl follows a redirect and if the request is a POST, it will send the following request with
              a GET if the HTTP response was 301, 302, or 303. If the response code was any other 3xx code,  curl
              will re‐send the following request using the same unmodified method.

              You  can  tell  curl to not change POST requests to GET after a 30x response by using the dedicated
              options for that: [4m--post301[24m, [4m--post302[24m and [4m--post303[24m.

              The method set with [4m-X,[24m [4m--request[24m overrides the method curl would otherwise select to use.

              Providing [4m-L,[24m [4m--location[24m multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it again with --no‐location.

              Example:
               curl ‐L https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐resolve[24m and [4m‐‐alt‐svc[24m.

       --login‐options <options>
              (IMAP LDAP POP3 SMTP) Specify the login options to use during server authentication.

              You can use login options to specify protocol specific options that may be used during  authentica‐
              tion.  At  present only IMAP, POP3 and SMTP support login options. For more information about login
              options please see RFC 2384, RFC 5092 and IETF draft draft‐earhart‐url‐smtp‐00.txt

              Since 8.2.0, IMAP supports the login option "AUTH=+LOGIN". With this option, curl  uses  the  plain
              (not  SASL)  LOGIN  IMAP  command even if the server advertises SASL authentication. Care should be
              taken in using this option, as it will send out your password in plain text. This will not work  if
              the IMAP server disables the plain LOGIN (e.g. to prevent password snooping).

              If [4m--login‐options[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐login‐options ’AUTH=*’ imap://example.com

              See also [4m‐u,[24m [4m‐‐user[24m. Added in 7.34.0.

       --mail‐auth <address>
              (SMTP) Specify a single address. This will be used to specify the authentication address (identity)
              of a submitted message that is being relayed to another server.

              If [4m--mail‐auth[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐mail‐auth user@example.come ‐T mail smtp://example.com/

              See also [4m‐‐mail‐rcpt[24m and [4m‐‐mail‐from[24m.

       --mail‐from <address>
              (SMTP) Specify a single address that the given mail should get sent from.

              If [4m--mail‐from[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐mail‐from user@example.com ‐T mail smtp://example.com/

              See also [4m‐‐mail‐rcpt[24m and [4m‐‐mail‐auth[24m.

       --mail‐rcpt‐allowfails
              (SMTP) When sending data to multiple recipients, by default curl will abort SMTP conversation if at
              least one of the recipients causes RCPT TO command to return an error.

              The  default  behavior  can  be changed by passing [4m--mail‐rcpt‐allowfails[24m command‐line option which
              will make curl ignore errors and proceed with the remaining valid recipients.

              If all recipients trigger RCPT TO failures and this flag is specified, curl will  still  abort  the
              SMTP conversation and return the error received from to the last RCPT TO command.

              Providing  [4m--mail‐rcpt‐allowfails[24m  multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it again with --no‐
              mail‐rcpt‐allowfails.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐mail‐rcpt‐allowfails ‐‐mail‐rcpt dest@example.com smtp://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐mail‐rcpt[24m. Added in 7.69.0.

       --mail‐rcpt <address>
              (SMTP) Specify a single email address, user name or mailing list name. Repeat this  option  several
              times to send to multiple recipients.

              When  performing  an  address verification (VRFY command), the recipient should be specified as the
              user name or user name and domain (as per Section 3.5 of RFC 5321). (Added in 7.34.0)

              When performing a mailing list expand (EXPN command), the recipient should be specified  using  the
              mailing list name, such as "Friends" or "London‐Office".  (Added in 7.34.0)

              [4m--mail‐rcpt[24m can be used several times in a command line

              Example:
               curl ‐‐mail‐rcpt user@example.net smtp://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐mail‐rcpt‐allowfails[24m.

       -M, --manual
              Manual. Display the huge help text.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐manual

              See also [4m‐v,[24m [4m‐‐verbose[24m, [4m‐‐libcurl[24m and [4m‐‐trace[24m.

       --max‐filesize <bytes>
              (FTP HTTP MQTT) Specify the maximum size (in bytes) of a file to download. If the file requested is
              larger than this value, the transfer will not start and curl will return with exit code 63.

              A  size modifier may be used. For example, Appending ’k’ or ’K’ will count the number as kilobytes,
              ’m’ or ’M’ makes it megabytes, while ’g’ or ’G’ makes it gigabytes.  Examples:  200K,  3m  and  1G.
              (Added in 7.58.0)

              [1mNOTE[22m:  The  file  size is not always known prior to download, and for such files this option has no
              effect even if the file transfer ends up being larger than this given limit.  If [4m--max‐filesize[24m  is
              provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐max‐filesize 100K https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐limit‐rate[24m.

       --max‐redirs <num>
              (HTTP)  Set  maximum number of redirections to follow. When [4m-L,[24m [4m--location[24m is used, to prevent curl
              from following too many redirects, by default, the limit is set to 50 redirects. Set this option to
              -1 to make it unlimited.

              If [4m--max‐redirs[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐max‐redirs 3 ‐‐location https://example.com

              See also [4m‐L,[24m [4m‐‐location[24m.

       -m, --max‐time <fractional seconds>
              Maximum time in seconds that you allow each transfer to take.  This is useful for  preventing  your
              batch jobs from hanging for hours due to slow networks or links going down.  Since 7.32.0, this op‐
              tion  accepts  decimal  values,  but  the actual timeout will decrease in accuracy as the specified
              timeout increases in decimal precision.

              If you enable retrying the transfer ([4m--retry[24m) then the maximum time counter is reset each time  the
              transfer is retried. You can use [4m--retry‐max‐time[24m to limit the retry time.

              The  decimal  value  needs to provided using a dot (.) as decimal separator - not the local version
              even if it might be using another separator.

              If [4m-m,[24m [4m--max‐time[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Examples:
               curl ‐‐max‐time 10 https://example.com
               curl ‐‐max‐time 2.92 https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐connect‐timeout[24m and [4m‐‐retry‐max‐time[24m.

       --metalink
              This option was previously used to specify a metalink resource. Metalink support has been  disabled
              in curl since 7.78.0 for security reasons.

              If [4m--metalink[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐metalink file https://example.com

              See also [4m‐Z,[24m [4m‐‐parallel[24m.

       --negotiate
              (HTTP) Enables Negotiate (SPNEGO) authentication.

              This option requires a library built with GSS‐API or SSPI support. Use [4m-V,[24m [4m--version[24m to see if your
              curl supports GSS‐API/SSPI or SPNEGO.

              When  using this option, you must also provide a fake [4m-u,[24m [4m--user[24m option to activate the authentica‐
              tion code properly. Sending a ’‐u :’ is enough as the user name and password from  the  [4m-u,[24m  [4m--user[0m
              option are not actually used.

              If this option is used several times, only the first one is used.

              Providing [4m--negotiate[24m multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐negotiate ‐u : https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐basic[24m, [4m‐‐ntlm[24m, [4m‐‐anyauth[24m and [4m‐‐proxy‐negotiate[24m.

       --netrc‐file <filename>
              This  option  is similar to [4m-n,[24m [4m--netrc[24m, except that you provide the path (absolute or relative) to
              the netrc file that curl should use. You can only specify one netrc file per invocation.

              It will abide by [4m--netrc‐optional[24m if specified.

              If [4m--netrc‐file[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐netrc‐file netrc https://example.com

              See also [4m‐n,[24m [4m‐‐netrc[24m, [4m‐u,[24m [4m‐‐user[24m and [4m‐K,[24m  [4m‐‐config[24m.  This  option  is  mutually  exclusive  to  [4m‐n,[0m
              [4m‐‐netrc[24m.

       --netrc‐optional
              Similar  to  [4m-n,[24m  [4m--netrc[24m, but this option makes the .netrc usage [1moptional [22mand not mandatory as the
              [4m-n,[24m [4m--netrc[24m option does.

              Providing [4m--netrc‐optional[24m multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it again  with  --no‐netrc‐
              optional.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐netrc‐optional https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐netrc‐file[24m. This option is mutually exclusive to [4m‐n,[24m [4m‐‐netrc[24m.

       -n, --netrc
              Makes curl scan the [4m.netrc[24m ([4m_netrc[24m on Windows) file in the user’s home directory for login name and
              password.  This is typically used for FTP on Unix. If used with HTTP, curl will enable user authen‐
              tication. See [4mnetrc(5)[24m and [4mftp(1)[24m for details on the file format. Curl will not  complain  if  that
              file  does not have the right permissions (it should be neither world‐ nor group‐readable). The en‐
              vironment variable "HOME" is used to find the home directory.

              A quick and simple example of how to setup a [4m.netrc[24m to allow curl to FTP to  the  machine  host.do‐
              main.com with user name ’myself’ and password ’secret’ could look similar to:

               machine host.domain.com
               login myself
               password secret

              Providing [4m-n,[24m [4m--netrc[24m multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it again with --no‐netrc.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐netrc https://example.com

              See  also  [4m‐‐netrc‐file[24m, [4m‐K,[24m [4m‐‐config[24m and [4m‐u,[24m [4m‐‐user[24m. This option is mutually exclusive to [4m‐‐netrc‐[0m
              [4mfile[24m and [4m‐‐netrc‐optional[24m.

       -:, --next
              Tells curl to use a separate operation for the following URL and associated  options.  This  allows
              you  to  send several URL requests, each with their own specific options, for example, such as dif‐
              ferent user names or custom requests for each.

              [4m-:,[24m [4m--next[24m will reset all local options and only global ones will have their values survive over to
              the operation following the [4m-:,[24m [4m--next[24m instruction. Global options include [4m-v,[24m [4m--verbose[24m,  [4m--trace[24m,
              [4m--trace‐ascii[24m and [4m--fail‐early[24m.

              For example, you can do both a GET and a POST in a single command line:

               curl www1.example.com --next -d postthis www2.example.com

              [4m-:,[24m [4m--next[24m can be used several times in a command line

              Examples:
               curl https://example.com ‐‐next ‐d postthis www2.example.com
               curl ‐I https://example.com ‐‐next https://example.net/

              See also [4m‐Z,[24m [4m‐‐parallel[24m and [4m‐K,[24m [4m‐‐config[24m. Added in 7.36.0.

       --no‐alpn
              (HTTPS) Disable the ALPN TLS extension. ALPN is enabled by default if libcurl was built with an SSL
              library that supports ALPN. ALPN is used by a libcurl that supports HTTP/2 to negotiate HTTP/2 sup‐
              port with the server during https sessions.

              Providing [4m--no‐alpn[24m multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it again with --alpn.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐no‐alpn https://example.com

              See  also [4m‐‐no‐npn[24m and [4m‐‐http2[24m. [4m‐‐no‐alpn[24m requires that the underlying libcurl was built to support
              TLS. Added in 7.36.0.

       -N, --no‐buffer
              Disables the buffering of the output stream. In normal work situations, curl will  use  a  standard
              buffered output stream that will have the effect that it will output the data in chunks, not neces‐
              sarily exactly when the data arrives.  Using this option will disable that buffering.

              Providing [4m-N,[24m [4m--no‐buffer[24m multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it again with --buffer.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐no‐buffer https://example.com

              See also [4m‐#,[24m [4m‐‐progress‐bar[24m.

       --no‐clobber
              When  used  in  conjunction  with the [4m-o,[24m [4m--output[24m, [4m-J,[24m [4m--remote‐header‐name[24m, [4m-O,[24m [4m--remote‐name[24m, or
              [4m--remote‐name‐all[24m options, curl avoids overwriting files that already exist. Instead, a dot  and  a
              number  gets appended to the name of the file that would be created, up to filename.100 after which
              it will not create any file.

              Note that this is the negated option name documented.  You can thus use --clobber  to  enforce  the
              clobbering, even if [4m-J,[24m [4m--remote‐header‐name[24m is specified.

              Providing [4m--no‐clobber[24m multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it again with --clobber.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐no‐clobber ‐‐output local/dir/file https://example.com

       --no‐keepalive
              Disables  the  use  of keepalive messages on the TCP connection. curl otherwise enables them by de‐
              fault.

              Note that this is the negated option name documented. You  can  thus  use  --keepalive  to  enforce
              keepalive.

              Providing [4m--no‐keepalive[24m multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it again with --keepalive.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐no‐keepalive https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐keepalive‐time[24m.

       --no‐npn
              (HTTPS) In curl 7.86.0 and later, curl never uses NPN.

              Disable  the  NPN TLS extension. NPN is enabled by default if libcurl was built with an SSL library
              that supports NPN. NPN is used by a libcurl that supports HTTP/2 to negotiate HTTP/2  support  with
              the server during https sessions.

              Providing [4m--no‐npn[24m multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it again with --npn.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐no‐npn https://example.com

              See  also [4m‐‐no‐alpn[24m and [4m‐‐http2[24m. [4m‐‐no‐npn[24m requires that the underlying libcurl was built to support
              TLS. Added in 7.36.0.

       --no‐progress‐meter
              Option to switch off the progress meter output without muting or otherwise  affecting  warning  and
              informational messages like [4m-s,[24m [4m--silent[24m does.

              Note  that  this is the negated option name documented. You can thus use --progress‐meter to enable
              the progress meter again.

              Providing  [4m--no‐progress‐meter[24m  multiple  times  has  no  extra  effect.   Disable  it  again  with
              --progress‐meter.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐no‐progress‐meter ‐o store https://example.com

              See also [4m‐v,[24m [4m‐‐verbose[24m and [4m‐s,[24m [4m‐‐silent[24m. Added in 7.67.0.

       --no‐sessionid
              (TLS)  Disable  curl’s  use  of SSL session‐ID caching. By default all transfers are done using the
              cache. Note that while nothing should ever get hurt by attempting to reuse SSL  session‐IDs,  there
              seem to be broken SSL implementations in the wild that may require you to disable this in order for
              you to succeed.

              Note  that this is the negated option name documented. You can thus use --sessionid to enforce ses‐
              sion‐ID caching.

              Providing [4m--no‐sessionid[24m multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it again with --sessionid.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐no‐sessionid https://example.com

              See also [4m‐k,[24m [4m‐‐insecure[24m.

       --noproxy <no‐proxy‐list>
              Comma‐separated list of hosts for which not to use a proxy, if one is specified. The only  wildcard
              is  a single * character, which matches all hosts, and effectively disables the proxy. Each name in
              this list is matched as either a domain which contains the hostname, or the  hostname  itself.  For
              example,  local.com  would  match  local.com,  local.com:80,  and www.local.com, but not www.notlo‐
              cal.com.

              Since 7.53.0, This option overrides the environment variables that disable  the  proxy  (’no_proxy’
              and ’NO_PROXY’). If there’s an environment variable disabling a proxy, you can set the noproxy list
              to "" to override it.

              Since  7.86.0,  IP  addresses  specified to this option can be provided using CIDR notation: an ap‐
              pended slash and number specifies the number of "network bits" out of the address  to  use  in  the
              comparison. For example "192.168.0.0/16" would match all addresses starting with "192.168".

              If [4m--noproxy[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐noproxy "www.example" https://example.com

              See also [4m‐x,[24m [4m‐‐proxy[24m.

       --ntlm‐wb
              (HTTP) Enables NTLM much in the style [4m--ntlm[24m does, but hand over the authentication to the separate
              binary ntlmauth application that is executed when needed.

              Providing [4m--ntlm‐wb[24m multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐ntlm‐wb ‐u user:password https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐ntlm[24m and [4m‐‐proxy‐ntlm[24m.

       --ntlm (HTTP) Enables NTLM authentication. The NTLM authentication method was designed by Microsoft and is
              used  by IIS web servers. It is a proprietary protocol, reverse‐engineered by clever people and im‐
              plemented in curl based on their efforts. This kind of behavior should not be endorsed, you  should
              encourage  everyone  who  uses  NTLM to switch to a public and documented authentication method in‐
              stead, such as Digest.

              If you want to enable NTLM for your proxy authentication, then use [4m--proxy‐ntlm[24m.

              If this option is used several times, only the first one is used.

              Providing [4m--ntlm[24m multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐ntlm ‐u user:password https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐proxy‐ntlm[24m. [4m‐‐ntlm[24m requires that the underlying libcurl was built to support  TLS.  This
              option is mutually exclusive to [4m‐‐basic[24m and [4m‐‐negotiate[24m and [4m‐‐digest[24m and [4m‐‐anyauth[24m.

       --oauth2‐bearer <token>
              (IMAP LDAP POP3 SMTP HTTP) Specify the Bearer Token for OAUTH 2.0 server authentication. The Bearer
              Token  is used in conjunction with the user name which can be specified as part of the [4m--url[24m or [4m-u,[0m
              [4m--user[24m options.

              The Bearer Token and user name are formatted according to RFC 6750.

              If [4m--oauth2‐bearer[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐oauth2‐bearer "mF_9.B5f‐4.1JqM" https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐basic[24m, [4m‐‐ntlm[24m and [4m‐‐digest[24m. Added in 7.33.0.

       --output‐dir <dir>
              This option specifies the directory in which files should be stored, when [4m-O,[24m [4m--remote‐name[24m or  [4m-o,[0m
              [4m--output[24m are used.

              The  given  output  directory is used for all URLs and output options on the command line, up until
              the first [4m-:,[24m [4m--next[24m.

              If the specified target directory does not exist, the operation will fail unless  [4m--create‐dirs[24m  is
              also used.

              If [4m--output‐dir[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐output‐dir "tmp" ‐O https://example.com

              See also [4m‐O,[24m [4m‐‐remote‐name[24m and [4m‐J,[24m [4m‐‐remote‐header‐name[24m. Added in 7.73.0.

       -o, --output <file>
              Write  output  to  <file> instead of stdout. If you are using {} or [] to fetch multiple documents,
              you should quote the URL and you can use ’#’ followed by a number in  the  <file>  specifier.  That
              variable will be replaced with the current string for the URL being fetched. Like in:

               curl "http://{one,two}.example.com" -o "file_#1.txt"

              or use several variables like:

               curl "http://{site,host}.host[1‐5].com" -o "#1_#2"

              You  may  use this option as many times as the number of URLs you have. For example, if you specify
              two URLs on the same command line, you can use it like this:

                curl -o aa example.com -o bb example.net

              and the order of the -o options and the URLs does not matter, just that the first  -o  is  for  the
              first URL and so on, so the above command line can also be written as

                curl example.com example.net -o aa -o bb

              See  also the [4m--create‐dirs[24m option to create the local directories dynamically. Specifying the out‐
              put as ’‐’ (a single dash) will force the output to be done to stdout.

              To suppress response bodies, you can redirect output to /dev/null:

                curl example.com -o /dev/null

              Or for Windows use nul:

                curl example.com -o nul

              [4m-o,[24m [4m--output[24m can be used several times in a command line

              Examples:
               curl ‐o file https://example.com
               curl "http://{one,two}.example.com" ‐o "file_#1.txt"
               curl "http://{site,host}.host[1‐5].com" ‐o "#1_#2"
               curl ‐o file https://example.com ‐o file2 https://example.net

       --parallel‐immediate
              When doing parallel transfers, this option will instruct curl that it should rather prefer  opening
              up more connections in parallel at once rather than waiting to see if new transfers can be added as
              multiplexed streams on another connection.

              This option is global and does not need to be specified for each use of ‐‐next.

              Providing [4m--parallel‐immediate[24m multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it again with --no‐par‐
              allel‐immediate.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐parallel‐immediate ‐Z https://example.com ‐o file1 https://example.com ‐o file2

              See also [4m‐Z,[24m [4m‐‐parallel[24m and [4m‐‐parallel‐max[24m. Added in 7.68.0.

       --parallel‐max <num>
              When  asked to do parallel transfers, using [4m-Z,[24m [4m--parallel[24m, this option controls the maximum amount
              of transfers to do simultaneously.

              This option is global and does not need to be specified for each use of [4m-:,[24m [4m--next[24m.

              The default is 50.

              If [4m--parallel‐max[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐parallel‐max 100 ‐Z https://example.com ftp://example.com/

              See also [4m‐Z,[24m [4m‐‐parallel[24m. Added in 7.66.0.

       -Z, --parallel
              Makes curl perform its transfers in parallel as compared to the regular serial manner.

              This option is global and does not need to be specified for each use of ‐‐next.

              Providing [4m-Z,[24m [4m--parallel[24m multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it again with --no‐parallel.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐parallel https://example.com ‐o file1 https://example.com ‐o file2

              See also [4m‐:,[24m [4m‐‐next[24m and [4m‐v,[24m [4m‐‐verbose[24m. Added in 7.66.0.

       --pass <phrase>
              (SSH TLS) Passphrase for the private key.

              If [4m--pass[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐pass secret ‐‐key file https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐key[24m and [4m‐u,[24m [4m‐‐user[24m.

       --path‐as‐is
              Tell curl to not handle sequences of /../ or /./ in the given URL path. Normally curl  will  squash
              or merge them according to standards but with this option set you tell it not to do that.

              Providing [4m--path‐as‐is[24m multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it again with --no‐path‐as‐is.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐path‐as‐is https://example.com/../../etc/passwd

              See also [4m‐‐request‐target[24m. Added in 7.42.0.

       --pinnedpubkey <hashes>
              (TLS) Tells curl to use the specified public key file (or hashes) to verify the peer. This can be a
              path to a file which contains a single public key in PEM or DER format, or any number of base64 en‐
              coded sha256 hashes preceded by 'sha256//’ and separated by ’;’.

              When negotiating a TLS or SSL connection, the server sends a certificate indicating its identity. A
              public  key is extracted from this certificate and if it does not exactly match the public key pro‐
              vided to this option, curl will abort the connection before sending or receiving any data.

              PEM/DER support:

              7.39.0: OpenSSL, GnuTLS and GSKit

              7.43.0: NSS and wolfSSL

              7.47.0: mbedtls

              sha256 support:

              7.44.0: OpenSSL, GnuTLS, NSS and wolfSSL

              7.47.0: mbedtls

              Other SSL backends not supported.

              If [4m--pinnedpubkey[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Examples:
               curl ‐‐pinnedpubkey keyfile https://example.com
               curl ‐‐pinnedpubkey ’sha256//ce118b51897f4452dc’ https://example.com

       --post301
              (HTTP) Tells curl to respect RFC 7231/6.4.2 and not convert POST requests into  GET  requests  when
              following  a  301 redirection. The non‐RFC behavior is ubiquitous in web browsers, so curl does the
              conversion by default to maintain consistency. However, a server may require a  POST  to  remain  a
              POST after such a redirection. This option is meaningful only when using [4m-L,[24m [4m--location[24m.

              Providing [4m--post301[24m multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it again with --no‐post301.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐post301 ‐‐location ‐d "data" https://example.com

       --post302
              (HTTP)  Tells  curl  to respect RFC 7231/6.4.3 and not convert POST requests into GET requests when
              following a 302 redirection. The non‐RFC behavior is ubiquitous in web browsers, so curl  does  the
              conversion  by  default  to  maintain consistency. However, a server may require a POST to remain a
              POST after such a redirection. This option is meaningful only when using [4m-L,[24m [4m--location[24m.

              Providing [4m--post302[24m multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it again with --no‐post302.

              Example:

       --post303
              (HTTP) Tells curl to violate RFC 7231/6.4.4 and not convert POST requests into  GET  requests  when
              following  303  redirections. A server may require a POST to remain a POST after a 303 redirection.
              This option is meaningful only when using [4m-L,[24m [4m--location[24m.

              Providing [4m--post303[24m multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it again with --no‐post303.

              Example:

       --preproxy [protocol://]host[:port]
              Use the specified SOCKS proxy before connecting to an HTTP or HTTPS [4m-x,[24m [4m--proxy[24m.  In  such  a  case
              curl  first  connects  to  the  SOCKS  proxy and then connects (through SOCKS) to the HTTP or HTTPS
              proxy. Hence pre proxy.

              The pre proxy string should be specified with a protocol:// prefix  to  specify  alternative  proxy
              protocols. Use socks4://, socks4a://, socks5:// or socks5h:// to request the specific SOCKS version
              to be used. No protocol specified will make curl default to SOCKS4.

              If the port number is not specified in the proxy string, it is assumed to be 1080.

              User  and  password that might be provided in the proxy string are URL decoded by curl. This allows
              you to pass in special characters such as @ by using %40 or pass in a colon with %3a.

              If [4m--preproxy[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐preproxy socks5://proxy.example ‐x http://http.example https://example.com

              See also [4m‐x,[24m [4m‐‐proxy[24m and [4m‐‐socks5[24m. Added in 7.52.0.

       -#, --progress‐bar
              Make curl display transfer progress as a simple progress bar instead of the standard, more informa‐
              tional, meter.

              This progress bar draws a single line of ’#’ characters across the screen and shows a percentage if
              the transfer size is known. For transfers without a known size, there will be  space  ship  (‐=o=‐)
              that  moves back and forth but only while data is being transferred, with a set of flying hash sign
              symbols on top.

              This option is global and does not need to be specified for each use of ‐‐next.

              Providing [4m-#,[24m [4m--progress‐bar[24m multiple times has no extra  effect.   Disable  it  again  with  --no‐
              progress‐bar.

              Example:
               curl ‐# ‐O https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐styled‐output[24m.

       --proto‐default <protocol>
              Tells curl to use [4mprotocol[24m for any URL missing a scheme name.

              An unknown or unsupported protocol causes error [4mCURLE_UNSUPPORTED_PROTOCOL[24m (1).

              This option does not change the default proxy protocol (http).

              Without this option set, curl guesses protocol based on the host name, see [4m--url[24m for details.

              If [4m--proto‐default[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐proto‐default https ftp.example.com

              See also [4m‐‐proto[24m and [4m‐‐proto‐redir[24m. Added in 7.45.0.

       --proto‐redir <protocols>
              Tells  curl  to  limit  what  protocols it may use on redirect. Protocols denied by [4m--proto[24m are not
              overridden by this option. See [4m--proto[24m for how protocols are represented.

              Example, allow only HTTP and HTTPS on redirect:

               curl --proto‐redir -all,http,https http://example.com

              By default curl will only allow HTTP, HTTPS, FTP and FTPS on redirect  (since  7.65.2).  Specifying
              [4mall[24m or [4m+all[24m enables all protocols on redirects, which is not good for security.

              If [4m--proto‐redir[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐proto‐redir =http,https https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐proto[24m.

       --proto <protocols>
              Tells curl to limit what protocols it may use for transfers. Protocols are evaluated left to right,
              are  comma  separated,  and  are each a protocol name or 'all’, optionally prefixed by zero or more
              modifiers. Available modifiers are:

              [1m+  [22mPermit this protocol in addition to protocols already permitted (this is the default if no modi‐
                 fier is used).

              [1m-  [22mDeny this protocol, removing it from the list of protocols already permitted.

              [1m=  [22mPermit only this protocol (ignoring the list already permitted), though subject to later modifi‐
                 cation by subsequent entries in the comma separated list.

              For example:

              [4m--proto[24m [1m-ftps  [22muses the default protocols, but disables ftps

              [4m--proto[24m [1m-all,https,+http[0m
                             only enables http and https

              [4m--proto[24m [1m=http,https[0m
                             also only enables http and https

              Unknown and disabled protocols produce a warning. This allows scripts to safely rely on being  able
              to  disable  potentially  dangerous protocols, without relying upon support for that protocol being
              built into curl to avoid an error.

              This option can be used multiple times, in which case the effect is the same as  concatenating  the
              protocols into one instance of the option.

              If [4m--proto[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐proto =http,https,sftp https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐proto‐redir[24m and [4m‐‐proto‐default[24m.

       --proxy‐anyauth
              Tells  curl  to pick a suitable authentication method when communicating with the given HTTP proxy.
              This might cause an extra request/response round‐trip.

              Providing [4m--proxy‐anyauth[24m multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐proxy‐anyauth ‐‐proxy‐user user:passwd ‐x proxy https://example.com

              See also [4m‐x,[24m [4m‐‐proxy[24m, [4m‐‐proxy‐basic[24m and [4m‐‐proxy‐digest[24m.

       --proxy‐basic
              Tells curl to use HTTP Basic authentication when communicating with the given  proxy.  Use  [4m--basic[0m
              for  enabling  HTTP  Basic with a remote host. Basic is the default authentication method curl uses
              with proxies.

              Providing [4m--proxy‐basic[24m multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐proxy‐basic ‐‐proxy‐user user:passwd ‐x proxy https://example.com

              See also [4m‐x,[24m [4m‐‐proxy[24m, [4m‐‐proxy‐anyauth[24m and [4m‐‐proxy‐digest[24m.

       --proxy‐ca‐native
              (TLS) Tells curl to use the CA store from the native operating system to verify the HTTPS proxy. By
              default, curl will otherwise use a CA store provided in a single file or directory, but when  using
              this option it will interface the operating system’s own vault.

              This option only works for curl on Windows when built to use OpenSSL. When curl on Windows is built
              to use Schannel, this feature is implied and curl then only uses the native CA store.

              Providing  [4m--proxy‐ca‐native[24m multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it again with --no‐proxy‐
              ca‐native.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐ca‐native https://example.com

       --proxy‐cacert <file>
              Same as [4m--cacert[24m but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              If [4m--proxy‐cacert[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐proxy‐cacert CA‐file.txt ‐x https://proxy https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐proxy‐capath[24m, [4m‐‐cacert[24m, [4m‐‐capath[24m and [4m‐x,[24m [4m‐‐proxy[24m. Added in 7.52.0.

       --proxy‐cert‐type <type>
              Same as [4m--cert‐type[24m but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              If [4m--proxy‐cert‐type[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:

              See also [4m‐‐proxy‐cert[24m. Added in 7.52.0.

       --proxy‐cert <cert[:passwd]>
              Same as [4m-E,[24m [4m--cert[24m but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              If [4m--proxy‐cert[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

       --proxy‐ciphers <list>
              Same as [4m--ciphers[24m but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              Specifies which ciphers to use in the connection to the HTTPS proxy. The list of ciphers must spec‐
              ify valid ciphers. Read up on SSL cipher list details on this URL:

              https://curl.se/docs/ssl‐ciphers.html

              If [4m--proxy‐ciphers[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:

       --proxy‐crlfile <file>
              Same as [4m--crlfile[24m but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              If [4m--proxy‐crlfile[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:

       --proxy‐digest
              Tells curl to use HTTP Digest authentication when communicating with the given proxy. Use  [4m--digest[0m
              for enabling HTTP Digest with a remote host.

              Providing [4m--proxy‐digest[24m multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐proxy‐digest ‐‐proxy‐user user:passwd ‐x proxy https://example.com

              See also [4m‐x,[24m [4m‐‐proxy[24m, [4m‐‐proxy‐anyauth[24m and [4m‐‐proxy‐basic[24m.

       --proxy‐header <header/@file>
              (HTTP)  Extra  header  to  include in the request when sending HTTP to a proxy. You may specify any
              number of extra headers. This is the equivalent option to [4m-H,[24m [4m--header[24m but is for proxy  communica‐
              tion  only  like  in  CONNECT requests when you want a separate header sent to the proxy to what is
              sent to the actual remote host.

              curl will make sure that each header you add/replace is sent with the  proper  end‐of‐line  marker,
              you  should  thus [1mnot [22madd that as a part of the header content: do not add newlines or carriage re‐
              turns, they will only mess things up for you.

              Headers specified with this option will not be included in requests that curl  knows  will  not  be
              sent to a proxy.

              Starting  in  7.55.0, this option can take an argument in @filename style, which then adds a header
              for each line in the input file. Using @‐ will make curl read the header file from stdin.

              This option can be used multiple times to add/replace/remove multiple headers.

              [4m--proxy‐header[24m can be used several times in a command line

              Examples:
               curl ‐‐proxy‐header "X‐First‐Name: Joe" ‐x http://proxy https://example.com
               curl ‐‐proxy‐header "User‐Agent: surprise" ‐x http://proxy https://example.com
               curl ‐‐proxy‐header "Host:" ‐x http://proxy https://example.com

              See also [4m‐x,[24m [4m‐‐proxy[24m. Added in 7.37.0.

       --proxy‐http2
              (HTTP) Tells curl to try negotiate HTTP version 2 with an HTTPS proxy. The proxy might  still  only
              offer HTTP/1 and then curl will stick to using that version.

              This has no effect for any other kinds of proxies.

              Providing  [4m--proxy‐http2[24m  multiple  times  has  no extra effect.  Disable it again with --no‐proxy‐
              http2.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐proxy‐http2 ‐x proxy https://example.com

              See also [4m‐x,[24m [4m‐‐proxy[24m. [4m‐‐proxy‐http2[24m requires that the  underlying  libcurl  was  built  to  support
              HTTP/2. Added in 8.1.0.

       --proxy‐insecure
              Same as [4m-k,[24m [4m--insecure[24m but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              Providing  [4m--proxy‐insecure[24m  multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it again with --no‐proxy‐
              insecure.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐proxy‐insecure ‐x https://proxy https://example.com

       --proxy‐key‐type <type>
              Same as [4m--key‐type[24m but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              If [4m--proxy‐key‐type[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:

              See also [4m‐‐proxy‐key[24m and [4m‐x,[24m [4m‐‐proxy[24m. Added in 7.52.0.

       --proxy‐key <key>
              Same as [4m--key[24m but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              If [4m--proxy‐key[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:

              See also [4m‐‐proxy‐key‐type[24m and [4m‐x,[24m [4m‐‐proxy[24m. Added in 7.52.0.

       --proxy‐negotiate
              Tells curl to use HTTP Negotiate (SPNEGO) authentication when communicating with the  given  proxy.
              Use [4m--negotiate[24m for enabling HTTP Negotiate (SPNEGO) with a remote host.

              Providing [4m--proxy‐negotiate[24m multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐proxy‐negotiate ‐‐proxy‐user user:passwd ‐x proxy https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐proxy‐anyauth[24m and [4m‐‐proxy‐basic[24m.

       --proxy‐ntlm
              Tells  curl to use HTTP NTLM authentication when communicating with the given proxy. Use [4m--ntlm[24m for
              enabling NTLM with a remote host.

              Providing [4m--proxy‐ntlm[24m multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐proxy‐ntlm ‐‐proxy‐user user:passwd ‐x http://proxy https://example.com

       --proxy‐pass <phrase>
              Same as [4m--pass[24m but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              If [4m--proxy‐pass[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐proxy‐pass secret ‐‐proxy‐key here ‐x https://proxy https://example.com

              See also [4m‐x,[24m [4m‐‐proxy[24m and [4m‐‐proxy‐key[24m. Added in 7.52.0.

       --proxy‐pinnedpubkey <hashes>
              (TLS) Tells curl to use the specified public key file (or hashes) to verify the proxy. This can  be
              a  path  to a file which contains a single public key in PEM or DER format, or any number of base64
              encoded sha256 hashes preceded by 'sha256//’ and separated by ’;’.

              When negotiating a TLS or SSL connection, the server sends a certificate indicating its identity. A
              public key is extracted from this certificate and if it does not exactly match the public key  pro‐
              vided to this option, curl will abort the connection before sending or receiving any data.

              If [4m--proxy‐pinnedpubkey[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Examples:
               curl ‐‐proxy‐pinnedpubkey keyfile https://example.com
               curl ‐‐proxy‐pinnedpubkey ’sha256//ce118b51897f4452dc’ https://example.com

              This option allows you to change the service name for proxy negotiation.

              If [4m--proxy‐service‐name[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:

              Same as [4m--ssl‐allow‐beast[24m but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              Providing  [4m--proxy‐ssl‐allow‐beast[24m multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it again with --no‐
              proxy‐ssl‐allow‐beast.

              Same as [4m--ssl‐auto‐client‐cert[24m but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              Providing [4m--proxy‐ssl‐auto‐client‐cert[24m multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it  again  with

              tails on this URL:

              https://curl.se/docs/ssl‐ciphers.html

              This option is currently used only when curl is built to use OpenSSL 1.1.1 or later. If you are us‐
              ing  a different SSL backend you can try setting TLS 1.3 cipher suites by using the [4m--proxy‐ciphers[0m
              option.

              If [4m--proxy‐tls13‐ciphers[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐proxy‐tls13‐ciphers TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 ‐x proxy https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐tls13‐ciphers[24m, [4m‐‐curves[24m and [4m‐‐proxy‐ciphers[24m. Added in 7.61.0.

       --proxy‐tlsauthtype <type>
              Same as [4m--tlsauthtype[24m but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              If [4m--proxy‐tlsauthtype[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐proxy‐tlsauthtype SRP ‐x https://proxy https://example.com

              See also [4m‐x,[24m [4m‐‐proxy[24m and [4m‐‐proxy‐tlsuser[24m. Added in 7.52.0.

       --proxy‐tlspassword <string>
              Same as [4m--tlspassword[24m but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              If [4m--proxy‐tlspassword[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐proxy‐tlspassword passwd ‐x https://proxy https://example.com

              See also [4m‐x,[24m [4m‐‐proxy[24m and [4m‐‐proxy‐tlsuser[24m. Added in 7.52.0.

       --proxy‐tlsuser <name>
              Same as [4m--tlsuser[24m but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              If [4m--proxy‐tlsuser[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐proxy‐tlsuser smith ‐x https://proxy https://example.com

              See also [4m‐x,[24m [4m‐‐proxy[24m and [4m‐‐proxy‐tlspassword[24m. Added in 7.52.0.

       --proxy‐tlsv1
              Same as [4m-1,[24m [4m--tlsv1[24m but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              Providing [4m--proxy‐tlsv1[24m multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐proxy‐tlsv1 ‐x https://proxy https://example.com

              See also [4m‐x,[24m [4m‐‐proxy[24m. Added in 7.52.0.

       -U, --proxy‐user <user:password>
              Specify the user name and password to use for proxy authentication.

              If you use a Windows SSPI‐enabled curl binary and do either Negotiate or NTLM  authentication  then
              you can tell curl to select the user name and password from your environment by specifying a single
              colon with this option: "‐U :".

              On  systems where it works, curl will hide the given option argument from process listings. This is
              not enough to protect credentials from possibly getting seen by other users on the same  system  as
              they  will  still  be  visible for a moment before cleared. Such sensitive data should be retrieved
              from a file instead or similar and never used in clear text in a command line.

              If [4m-U,[24m [4m--proxy‐user[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐proxy‐user name:pwd ‐x proxy https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐proxy‐pass[24m.

       -x, --proxy [protocol://]host[:port]
              Use the specified proxy.

              The proxy string can be specified with a protocol:// prefix. No protocol specified or http://  will
              be  treated as HTTP proxy. Use socks4://, socks4a://, socks5:// or socks5h:// to request a specific
              SOCKS version to be used.

              Unix domain sockets are  supported  for  socks  proxy.  Set  localhost  for  the  host  part.  e.g.
              socks5h://localhost/path/to/socket.sock

              HTTPS  proxy  support via https:// protocol prefix was added in 7.52.0 for OpenSSL, GnuTLS and NSS.
              Since 7.87.0, it also works for BearSSL, mbedTLS, rustls, Schannel, Secure Transport and wolfSSL.

              Unrecognized and unsupported proxy protocols cause an error since 7.52.0.  Prior versions  may  ig‐
              nore the protocol and use http:// instead.

              If the port number is not specified in the proxy string, it is assumed to be 1080.

              This option overrides existing environment variables that set the proxy to use. If there’s an envi‐
              ronment variable setting a proxy, you can set proxy to "" to override it.

              All  operations  that  are performed over an HTTP proxy will transparently be converted to HTTP. It
              means that certain protocol specific operations might not be available. This is not the case if you
              can tunnel through the proxy, as one with the [4m-p,[24m [4m--proxytunnel[24m option.

              User and password that might be provided in the proxy string are URL decoded by curl.  This  allows
              you to pass in special characters such as @ by using %40 or pass in a colon with %3a.

              The proxy host can be specified the same way as the proxy environment variables, including the pro‐
              tocol prefix (http://) and the embedded user + password.

              When a proxy is used, the active FTP mode as set with [4m-P,[24m [4m--ftp‐port[24m, cannot be used.

              If [4m-x,[24m [4m--proxy[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐proxy http://proxy.example https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐socks5[24m and [4m‐‐proxy‐basic[24m.

       --proxy1.0 <host[:port]>
              Use the specified HTTP 1.0 proxy. If the port number is not specified, it is assumed at port 1080.

              The  only  difference  between  this and the HTTP proxy option [4m-x,[24m [4m--proxy[24m, is that attempts to use
              CONNECT through the proxy will specify an HTTP 1.0 protocol instead of the default HTTP 1.1.

              Providing [4m--proxy1.0[24m multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐proxy1.0 ‐x http://proxy https://example.com

              See also [4m‐x,[24m [4m‐‐proxy[24m, [4m‐‐socks5[24m and [4m‐‐preproxy[24m.

       -p, --proxytunnel
              When an HTTP proxy is used [4m-x,[24m [4m--proxy[24m, this option will make curl tunnel through  the  proxy.  The
              tunnel  approach is made with the HTTP proxy CONNECT request and requires that the proxy allows di‐
              rect connect to the remote port number curl wants to tunnel through to.

              To suppress proxy CONNECT response headers when curl is set to output headers  use  [4m--suppress‐con‐[0m
              [4mnect‐headers[24m.

              Providing  [4m-p,[24m [4m--proxytunnel[24m multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it again with --no‐proxy‐
              tunnel.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐proxytunnel ‐x http://proxy https://example.com

              See also [4m‐x,[24m [4m‐‐proxy[24m.

       --pubkey <key>
              (SFTP SCP) Public key file name. Allows you to provide your public key in this separate file.

              (As of 7.39.0, curl attempts to automatically extract the public key from the private key file,  so
              passing  this  option  is  generally  not  required.  Note that this public key extraction requires
              libcurl to be linked against a copy of libssh2 1.2.8  or  higher  that  is  itself  linked  against
              OpenSSL.)

              If [4m--pubkey[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐pubkey file.pub sftp://example.com/

              See also [4m‐‐pass[24m.

       -Q, --quote <command>
              (FTP  SFTP) Send an arbitrary command to the remote FTP or SFTP server. Quote commands are sent BE‐
              FORE the transfer takes place (just after the initial PWD command in an FTP transfer, to be exact).
              To make commands take place after a successful transfer, prefix them with a dash ’‐’.

              (FTP only) To make commands be sent after curl has changed the working directory, just  before  the
              file  transfer  command(s),  prefix  the command with a '+’. This is not performed when a directory
              listing is performed.

              You may specify any number of commands.

              By default curl will stop at first failure. To make curl continue even if the command fails, prefix
              the command with an asterisk (*). Otherwise, if the server returns failure for one of the commands,
              the entire operation will be aborted.

              You must send syntactically correct FTP commands as RFC 959 defines to FTP servers, or one  of  the
              commands listed below to SFTP servers.

              SFTP  is a binary protocol. Unlike for FTP, curl interprets SFTP quote commands itself before send‐
              ing them to the server. File names may be quoted shell‐style to embed spaces or special characters.
              Following is the list of all supported SFTP quote commands:

              [1matime date file[0m
                     The atime command sets the last access time of the file named by the file operand. The <date
                     expression> can be all sorts of date strings, see the [4mcurl_getdate(3)[24m man page for date  ex‐
                     pression details. (Added in 7.73.0)

              [1mchgrp group file[0m
                     The  chgrp  command  sets the group ID of the file named by the file operand to the group ID
                     specified by the group operand. The group operand is a decimal integer group ID.

              [1mchmod mode file[0m
                     The chmod command modifies the file mode bits of the specified file. The mode operand is  an
                     octal integer mode number.

              [1mchown user file[0m
                     The chown command sets the owner of the file named by the file operand to the user ID speci‐
                     fied by the user operand. The user operand is a decimal integer user ID.

              [1mln source_file target_file[0m
                     The  ln  and symlink commands create a symbolic link at the target_file location pointing to
                     the source_file location.

              [1mmkdir directory_name[0m
                     The mkdir command creates the directory named by the directory_name operand.

              [1mmtime date file[0m
                     The mtime command sets the last modification time of the file named by the file operand. The
                     <date expression> can be all sorts of date strings, see the  [4mcurl_getdate(3)[24m  man  page  for
                     date expression details. (Added in 7.73.0)

              [1mpwd    [22mThe pwd command returns the absolute pathname of the current working directory.

              [1mrename source target[0m
                     The rename command renames the file or directory named by the source operand to the destina‐
                     tion path named by the target operand.

              [1mrm file[0m
                     The rm command removes the file specified by the file operand.

              [1mrmdir directory[0m
                     The  rmdir  command removes the directory entry specified by the directory operand, provided
                     it is empty.

              [1msymlink source_file target_file[0m
                     See ln.

              [4m-Q,[24m [4m--quote[24m can be used several times in a command line

              Example:
               curl ‐‐quote "DELE file" ftp://example.com/foo

              See also [4m‐X,[24m [4m‐‐request[24m.

       --random‐file <file>
              Deprecated option. This option is ignored by curl since 7.84.0. Prior to that it only had an effect
              on curl if built to use old versions of OpenSSL.

              Specify the path name to file containing what will be considered as random data. The  data  may  be
              used to seed the random engine for SSL connections.

              If [4m--random‐file[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐random‐file rubbish https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐egd‐file[24m.

       -r, --range <range>
              (HTTP  FTP SFTP FILE) Retrieve a byte range (i.e. a partial document) from an HTTP/1.1, FTP or SFTP
              server or a local FILE. Ranges can be specified in a number of ways.

              [1m0‐499     [22mspecifies the first 500 bytes

              [1m500‐999   [22mspecifies the second 500 bytes

              [1m-500      [22mspecifies the last 500 bytes

              [1m9500‐     [22mspecifies the bytes from offset 9500 and forward

              [1m0‐0,‐1    [22mspecifies the first and last byte only(*)(HTTP)

              [1m100‐199,500‐599[0m
                        specifies two separate 100‐byte ranges(*) (HTTP)

              (*) = NOTE that this will cause the server to reply with a multipart response, which  will  be  re‐
              turned  as‐is by curl! Parsing or otherwise transforming this response is the responsibility of the
              caller.

              Only digit characters (0‐9) are valid in the ’start’ and ’stop’ fields of  the  'start‐stop’  range
              syntax.  If a non‐digit character is given in the range, the server’s response will be unspecified,
              depending on the server’s configuration.

              You should also be aware that many HTTP/1.1 servers do not have this feature enabled, so that  when
              you attempt to get a range, you will instead get the whole document.

              FTP  and  SFTP  range downloads only support the simple ’start‐stop’ syntax (optionally with one of
              the numbers omitted). FTP use depends on the extended FTP command SIZE.

              If [4m-r,[24m [4m--range[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐range 22‐44 https://example.com

              See also [4m‐C,[24m [4m‐‐continue‐at[24m and [4m‐a,[24m [4m‐‐append[24m.

       --rate <max request rate>
              Specify the maximum transfer frequency you allow curl to use - in number  of  transfer  starts  per
              time  unit  (sometimes called request rate). Without this option, curl will start the next transfer
              as fast as possible.

              If given several URLs and a transfer completes faster than the allowed rate, curl will  wait  until
              the  next  transfer  is  started to maintain the requested rate. This option has no effect when [4m-Z,[0m
              [4m--parallel[24m is used.

              The request rate is provided as "N/U" where N is an integer number and U is a time unit.  Supported
              units  are ’s’ (second), ’m’ (minute), ’h’ (hour) and ’d’ /(day, as in a 24 hour unit). The default
              time unit, if no "/U" is provided, is number of transfers per hour.

              If curl is told to allow 10 requests per minute, it will not start the next request until 6 seconds
              have elapsed since the previous transfer was started.

              This function uses millisecond resolution. If the allowed frequency is set more than 1000 per  sec‐
              ond, it will instead run unrestricted.

              When  retrying transfers, enabled with [4m--retry[24m, the separate retry delay logic is used and not this
              setting.

              This option is global and does not need to be specified for each use of ‐‐next.

              If [4m--rate[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Examples:
               curl ‐‐rate 2/s https://example.com ...
               curl ‐‐rate 3/h https://example.com ...
               curl ‐‐rate 14/m https://example.com ...

              See also [4m‐‐limit‐rate[24m and [4m‐‐retry‐delay[24m. Added in 7.84.0.

       --raw  (HTTP) When used, it disables all internal HTTP decoding of content or transfer encodings  and  in‐
              stead makes them passed on unaltered, raw.

              Providing [4m--raw[24m multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it again with --no‐raw.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐raw https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐tr‐encoding[24m.

       -e, --referer <URL>
              (HTTP)  Sends the "Referrer Page" information to the HTTP server. This can also be set with the [4m-H,[0m
              [4m--header[24m flag of course. When used with [4m-L,[24m [4m--location[24m you can append ";auto" to the [4m-e,[24m  [4m--referer[0m
              URL to make curl automatically set the previous URL when it follows a Location: header. The ";auto"
              string can be used alone, even if you do not set an initial [4m-e,[24m [4m--referer[24m.

              If [4m-e,[24m [4m--referer[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Examples:
               curl ‐‐referer "https://fake.example" https://example.com
               curl ‐‐referer "https://fake.example;auto" ‐L https://example.com
               curl ‐‐referer ";auto" ‐L https://example.com

       -J, --remote‐header‐name
              (HTTP)  This option tells the [4m-O,[24m [4m--remote‐name[24m option to use the server‐specified Content‐Disposi‐
              tion filename instead of extracting a filename from the URL. If the server‐provided file name  con‐
              tains a path, that will be stripped off before the file name is used.

              The file is saved in the current directory, or in the directory specified with [4m--output‐dir[24m.

              If the server specifies a file name and a file with that name already exists in the destination di‐
              rectory,  it  will  not  be  overwritten and an error will occur - unless you allow it by using the
              --clobber option. If the server does not specify a file name then this option has no effect.

              There’s no attempt to decode %‐sequences (yet) in the provided file name, so this option  may  pro‐
              vide you with rather unexpected file names.

              This feature uses the name from the "filename" field, it does not yet support the "filename*" field
              (filenames with explicit character sets).

              [1mWARNING[22m:  Exercise  judicious  use of this option, especially on Windows. A rogue server could send
              you the name of a DLL or other file that could be loaded automatically by  Windows  or  some  third
              party software.

              Providing [4m-J,[24m [4m--remote‐header‐name[24m multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it again with --no‐
              remote‐header‐name.

              Example:
               curl ‐OJ https://example.com/file

              See also [4m‐O,[24m [4m‐‐remote‐name[24m.

       --remote‐name‐all
              This  option changes the default action for all given URLs to be dealt with as if [4m-O,[24m [4m--remote‐name[0m
              were used for each one. So if you want to disable that for a specific URL  after  [4m--remote‐name‐all[0m
              has been used, you must use "‐o -" or --no‐remote‐name.

              Providing [4m--remote‐name‐all[24m multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it again with --no‐remote‐
              name‐all.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐remote‐name‐all ftp://example.com/file1 ftp://example.com/file2

              See also [4m‐O,[24m [4m‐‐remote‐name[24m.

       -O, --remote‐name
              Write  output  to a local file named like the remote file we get. (Only the file part of the remote
              file is used, the path is cut off.)

              The file will be saved in the current working directory. If you want the file saved in a  different
              directory, make sure you change the current working directory before invoking curl with this option
              or use [4m--output‐dir[24m.

              The remote file name to use for saving is extracted from the given URL, nothing else, and if it al‐
              ready  exists it will be overwritten. If you want the server to be able to choose the file name re‐
              fer to [4m-J,[24m [4m--remote‐header‐name[24m which can be used in addition to this option. If the server chooses
              a file name and that name already exists it will not be overwritten.

              There is no URL decoding done on the file name. If it has %20 or other URL  encoded  parts  of  the
              name, they will end up as‐is as file name.

              You may use this option as many times as the number of URLs you have.

              [4m-O,[24m [4m--remote‐name[24m can be used several times in a command line

              Example:
               curl ‐O https://example.com/filename

              See also [4m‐‐remote‐name‐all[24m, [4m‐‐output‐dir[24m and [4m‐J,[24m [4m‐‐remote‐header‐name[24m.

       -R, --remote‐time
              When  used, this will make curl attempt to figure out the timestamp of the remote file, and if that
              is available make the local file get that same timestamp.

              Providing [4m-R,[24m [4m--remote‐time[24m multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it again with --no‐remote‐
              time.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐remote‐time ‐o foo https://example.com

              See also [4m‐O,[24m [4m‐‐remote‐name[24m and [4m‐z,[24m [4m‐‐time‐cond[24m.

       --remove‐on‐error
              When curl returns an error when told to save output in a local file, this option removes that saved
              file before exiting. This prevents curl from leaving a partial file in the case of an error  during
              transfer.

              If the output is not a file, this option has no effect.

              Providing [4m--remove‐on‐error[24m multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it again with --no‐remove‐
              on‐error.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐remove‐on‐error ‐o output https://example.com

              See also [4m‐f,[24m [4m‐‐fail[24m. Added in 7.83.0.

       --request‐target <path>
              (HTTP)  Tells  curl  to use an alternative "target" (path) instead of using the path as provided in
              the URL. Particularly useful when wanting to issue HTTP requests without  leading  slash  or  other
              data that does not follow the regular URL pattern, like "OPTIONS *".

              If [4m--request‐target[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐request‐target "*" ‐X OPTIONS https://example.com

              See also [4m‐X,[24m [4m‐‐request[24m. Added in 7.55.0.

       -X, --request <method>
              (HTTP) Specifies a custom request method to use when communicating with the HTTP server. The speci‐
              fied request method will be used instead of the method otherwise used (which defaults to GET). Read
              the  HTTP  1.1  specification for details and explanations. Common additional HTTP requests include
              PUT and DELETE, but related technologies like WebDAV offers PROPFIND, COPY, MOVE and more.

              Normally you do not need this option. All sorts of GET, HEAD, POST and PUT requests are rather  in‐
              voked by using dedicated command line options.

              This  option  only changes the actual word used in the HTTP request, it does not alter the way curl
              behaves. So for example if you want to make a proper HEAD request, using -X HEAD will not  suffice.
              You need to use the [4m-I,[24m [4m--head[24m option.

              The  method string you set with [4m-X,[24m [4m--request[24m will be used for all requests, which if you for exam‐
              ple use [4m-L,[24m [4m--location[24m may cause unintended side‐effects when curl does not change  request  method
              according to the HTTP 30x response codes - and similar.

              (FTP) Specifies a custom FTP command to use instead of LIST when doing file lists with FTP.

              (POP3) Specifies a custom POP3 command to use instead of LIST or RETR.

              (IMAP) Specifies a custom IMAP command to use instead of LIST. (Added in 7.30.0)

              (SMTP) Specifies a custom SMTP command to use instead of HELP or VRFY. (Added in 7.34.0)

              If [4m-X,[24m [4m--request[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Examples:
               curl ‐X "DELETE" https://example.com
               curl ‐X NLST ftp://example.com/

              See also [4m‐‐request‐target[24m.

       --resolve <[+]host:port:addr[,addr]...>
              Provide  a  custom address for a specific host and port pair. Using this, you can make the curl re‐
              quests(s) use a specified address and prevent the otherwise normally resolved address to  be  used.
              Consider  it  a sort of /etc/hosts alternative provided on the command line. The port number should
              be the number used for the specific protocol the host will be used for. It means you  need  several
              entries if you want to provide address for the same host but different ports.

              By specifying ’*’ as host you can tell curl to resolve any host and specific port pair to the spec‐
              ified  address.  Wildcard  is  resolved last so any [4m--resolve[24m with a specific host and port will be
              used first.

              The provided address set by this option will be used even if [4m-4,[24m [4m--ipv4[24m or [4m-6,[24m  [4m--ipv6[24m  is  set  to
              make curl use another IP version.

              By  prefixing  the  host with a ’+’ you can make the entry time out after curl’s default timeout (1
              minute). Note that this will only make sense for long running parallel  transfers  with  a  lot  of
              files. In such cases, if this option is used curl will try to resolve the host as it normally would
              once the timeout has expired.

              Support for providing the IP address within [brackets] was added in 7.57.0.

              Support for providing multiple IP addresses per entry was added in 7.59.0.

              Support for resolving with wildcard was added in 7.64.0.

              Support for the ’+’ prefix was was added in 7.75.0.

              This option can be used many times to add many host names to resolve.

              [4m--resolve[24m can be used several times in a command line

              Example:
               curl ‐‐resolve example.com:443:127.0.0.1 https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐connect‐to[24m and [4m‐‐alt‐svc[24m.

       --retry‐all‐errors
              Retry on any error. This option is used together with [4m--retry[24m.

              This  option  is  the "sledgehammer" of retrying. Do not use this option by default (eg in curlrc),
              there may be unintended consequences such as sending or receiving duplicate data. Do not  use  with
              redirected input or output. You’d be much better off handling your unique problems in shell script.
              Please read the example below.

              [1mWARNING[22m:  For server compatibility curl attempts to retry failed flaky transfers as close as possi‐
              ble to how they were started, but this is not possible with redirected input or output.  For  exam‐
              ple,  before  retrying it removes output data from a failed partial transfer that was written to an
              output file. However this is not true of data redirected to a | pipe or > file, which are  not  re‐
              set.  We  strongly  suggest you do not parse or record output via redirect in combination with this
              option, since you may receive duplicate data.

              By default curl will not error on an HTTP response code that indicates an HTTP error, if the trans‐
              fer was successful. For example, if a server replies 404 Not Found and the reply is fully  received
              then  that  is  not an error. When [4m--retry[24m is used then curl will retry on some HTTP response codes
              that indicate transient HTTP errors, but that does not include most 4xx response codes such as 404.
              If you want to retry on all response codes that indicate HTTP errors (4xx  and  5xx)  then  combine
              with [4m-f,[24m [4m--fail[24m.

              Providing [4m--retry‐all‐errors[24m multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it again with --no‐retry‐
              all‐errors.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐retry 5 ‐‐retry‐all‐errors https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐retry[24m. Added in 7.71.0.

       --retry‐connrefused
              In  addition  to  the other conditions, consider ECONNREFUSED as a transient error too for [4m--retry[24m.
              This option is used together with [4m--retry[24m.

              Providing [4m--retry‐connrefused[24m multiple times has no extra effect.   Disable  it  again  with  --no‐
              retry‐connrefused.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐retry‐connrefused ‐‐retry 7 https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐retry[24m and [4m‐‐retry‐all‐errors[24m. Added in 7.52.0.

       --retry‐delay <seconds>
              Make  curl  sleep this amount of time before each retry when a transfer has failed with a transient
              error (it changes the default backoff time algorithm between retries). This option is  only  inter‐
              esting  if  [4m--retry[24m is also used. Setting this delay to zero will make curl use the default backoff
              time.

              If [4m--retry‐delay[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐retry‐delay 5 ‐‐retry 7 https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐retry[24m.

       --retry‐max‐time <seconds>
              The retry timer is reset before the first transfer attempt. Retries will  be  done  as  usual  (see
              [4m--retry[24m)  as  long  as the timer has not reached this given limit. Notice that if the timer has not
              reached the limit, the request will be made and while performing, it  may  take  longer  than  this
              given time period. To limit a single request’s maximum time, use [4m-m,[24m [4m--max‐time[24m. Set this option to
              zero to not timeout retries.

              If [4m--retry‐max‐time[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐retry‐max‐time 30 ‐‐retry 10 https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐retry[24m.

       --retry <num>
              If  a  transient error is returned when curl tries to perform a transfer, it will retry this number
              of times before giving up. Setting the number to 0 makes curl do no retries (which is the default).
              Transient error means either: a timeout, an FTP 4xx response code or an HTTP 408,  429,  500,  502,
              503 or 504 response code.

              When  curl is about to retry a transfer, it will first wait one second and then for all forthcoming
              retries it will double the waiting time until it reaches 10 minutes which then will  be  the  delay
              between  the rest of the retries. By using [4m--retry‐delay[24m you disable this exponential backoff algo‐
              rithm. See also [4m--retry‐max‐time[24m to limit the total time allowed for retries.

              Since curl 7.66.0, curl will comply with the Retry‐After: response header if  one  was  present  to
              know when to issue the next retry.

              If [4m--retry[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐retry 7 https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐retry‐max‐time[24m.

       --sasl‐authzid <identity>
              Use this authorization identity (authzid), during SASL PLAIN authentication, in addition to the au‐
              thentication identity (authcid) as specified by [4m-u,[24m [4m--user[24m.

              If  the option is not specified, the server will derive the authzid from the authcid, but if speci‐
              fied, and depending on the server implementation, it may be used to access  another  user’s  inbox,
              that the user has been granted access to, or a shared mailbox for example.

              If [4m--sasl‐authzid[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐sasl‐authzid zid imap://example.com/

              See also [4m‐‐login‐options[24m. Added in 7.66.0.

       --sasl‐ir
              Enable initial response in SASL authentication.

              Providing [4m--sasl‐ir[24m multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it again with --no‐sasl‐ir.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐sasl‐ir imap://example.com/

              See also [4m‐‐sasl‐authzid[24m. Added in 7.31.0.

       --service‐name <name>
              This option allows you to change the service name for SPNEGO.

              Examples: [4m--negotiate[24m [4m--service‐name[24m sockd would use sockd/server‐name.

              If [4m--service‐name[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐service‐name sockd/server https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐negotiate[24m and [4m‐‐proxy‐service‐name[24m. Added in 7.43.0.

       -S, --show‐error
              When used with [4m-s,[24m [4m--silent[24m, it makes curl show an error message if it fails.

              This option is global and does not need to be specified for each use of ‐‐next.

              Providing [4m-S,[24m [4m--show‐error[24m multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it again with --no‐show‐er‐
              ror.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐show‐error ‐‐silent https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐no‐progress‐meter[24m.

       -s, --silent
              Silent  or quiet mode. Do not show progress meter or error messages. Makes Curl mute. It will still
              output the data you ask for, potentially even to the terminal/stdout unless you redirect it.

              Use [4m-S,[24m [4m--show‐error[24m in addition to this option to disable progress meter but still show error mes‐
              sages.

              Providing [4m-s,[24m [4m--silent[24m multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it again with --no‐silent.

              Example:
               curl ‐s https://example.com

              See also [4m‐v,[24m [4m‐‐verbose[24m, [4m‐‐stderr[24m and [4m‐‐no‐progress‐meter[24m.

       --socks4 <host[:port]>
              Use the specified SOCKS4 proxy. If the port number is not specified, it is assumed  at  port  1080.
              Using this socket type make curl resolve the host name and passing the address on to the proxy.

              To  specify  proxy  on  a  unix  domain  socket,  use  localhost  for  host,  e.g.  socks4://local‐
              host/path/to/socket.sock

              This option overrides any previous use of [4m-x,[24m [4m--proxy[24m, as they are mutually exclusive.

              This option is superfluous since you can specify a socks4 proxy with [4m-x,[24m [4m--proxy[24m using a  socks4://
              protocol prefix.

              Since  7.52.0, [4m--preproxy[24m can be used to specify a SOCKS proxy at the same time [4m-x,[24m [4m--proxy[24m is used
              with an HTTP/HTTPS proxy. In such a case curl first connects to the SOCKS proxy and  then  connects
              (through SOCKS) to the HTTP or HTTPS proxy.

              If [4m--socks4[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:

              See also [4m‐‐socks4a[24m, [4m‐‐socks5[24m and [4m‐‐socks5‐hostname[24m.

       --socks4a <host[:port]>
              Use  the  specified SOCKS4a proxy. If the port number is not specified, it is assumed at port 1080.
              This asks the proxy to resolve the host name.

              To specify proxy  on  a  unix  domain  socket,  use  localhost  for  host,  e.g.   socks4a://local‐
              host/path/to/socket.sock

              This option overrides any previous use of [4m-x,[24m [4m--proxy[24m, as they are mutually exclusive.

              This  option  is  superfluous  since  you  can  specify  a  socks4a  proxy with [4m-x,[24m [4m--proxy[24m using a
              socks4a:// protocol prefix.

       --socks5‐basic
              Tells curl to use username/password authentication when connecting to a SOCKS5  proxy.   The  user‐
              name/password authentication is enabled by default.  Use [4m--socks5‐gssapi[24m to force GSS‐API authenti‐
              cation to SOCKS5 proxies.

              Providing [4m--socks5‐basic[24m multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐socks5‐basic ‐‐socks5 hostname:4096 https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐socks5[24m. Added in 7.55.0.

       --socks5‐gssapi‐nec
              As  part  of  the  GSS‐API  negotiation  a  protection mode is negotiated. RFC 1961 says in section
              4.3/4.4 it should be  protected,  but  the  NEC  reference  implementation  does  not.  The  option
              [4m--socks5‐gssapi‐nec[24m allows the unprotected exchange of the protection mode negotiation.

              Providing  [4m--socks5‐gssapi‐nec[24m  multiple  times  has  no extra effect.  Disable it again with --no‐
              socks5‐gssapi‐nec.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐socks5‐gssapi‐nec ‐‐socks5 hostname:4096 https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐socks5[24m.

       --socks5‐gssapi‐service <name>
              The default service name for a socks server is rcmd/server‐fqdn. This option allows you  to  change
              it.

              Examples:  [4m--socks5[24m  proxy‐name  [4m--socks5‐gssapi‐service[24m  sockd would use sockd/proxy‐name [4m--socks5[0m
              proxy‐name [4m--socks5‐gssapi‐service[24m sockd/real‐name would use sockd/real‐name for  cases  where  the
              proxy‐name does not match the principal name.

              If [4m--socks5‐gssapi‐service[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:

              See also [4m‐‐socks5[24m.

       --socks5‐gssapi
              Tells  curl to use GSS‐API authentication when connecting to a SOCKS5 proxy.  The GSS‐API authenti‐
              cation is enabled by default (if curl is compiled with GSS‐API  support).   Use  [4m--socks5‐basic[24m  to
              force username/password authentication to SOCKS5 proxies.

              Providing  [4m--socks5‐gssapi[24m  multiple  times  has  no  extra  effect.   Disable  it again with --no‐

       --socks5‐hostname <host[:port]>
              Use the specified SOCKS5 proxy (and let the proxy resolve the host name). If the port number is not
              specified, it is assumed at port 1080.

              To specify proxy  on  a  unix  domain  socket,  use  localhost  for  host,  e.g.   socks5h://local‐
              host/path/to/socket.sock

              This option overrides any previous use of [4m-x,[24m [4m--proxy[24m, as they are mutually exclusive.

              This  option  is superfluous since you can specify a socks5 hostname proxy with [4m-x,[24m [4m--proxy[24m using a
              socks5h:// protocol prefix.

       --socks5 <host[:port]>
              Use the specified SOCKS5 proxy - but resolve the host name locally. If the port number is not spec‐
              ified, it is assumed at port 1080.

              To specify  proxy  on  a  unix  domain  socket,  use  localhost  for  host,  e.g.   socks5://local‐

              (through SOCKS) to the HTTP or HTTPS proxy.

              This option (as well as [4m--socks4[24m) does not work with IPV6, FTPS or LDAP.

              If [4m--socks5[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:

       -Y, --speed‐limit <speed>
              If a transfer is slower than this given speed (in bytes per second) for speed‐time seconds it  gets
              aborted. speed‐time is set with [4m-y,[24m [4m--speed‐time[24m and is 30 if not set.

              If [4m-Y,[24m [4m--speed‐limit[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:

              See also [4m‐y,[24m [4m‐‐speed‐time[24m, [4m‐‐limit‐rate[24m and [4m‐m,[24m [4m‐‐max‐time[24m.

       -y, --speed‐time <seconds>
              If  a transfer runs slower than speed‐limit bytes per second during a speed‐time period, the trans‐
              fer is aborted. If speed‐time is used, the default speed‐limit  will  be  1  unless  set  with  [4m-Y,[0m
              [4m--speed‐limit[24m.

              This  option controls transfers (in both directions) but will not affect slow connects etc. If this
              is a concern for you, try the [4m--connect‐timeout[24m option.

              If [4m-y,[24m [4m--speed‐time[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

       --ssl‐allow‐beast
              This option tells curl to not work around a security flaw in the SSL3 and TLS1.0 protocols known as
              BEAST.  If this option is not used, the SSL layer may use workarounds known to cause interoperabil‐
              ity problems with some older SSL implementations.

              [1mWARNING[22m: this option loosens the SSL security, and by using this flag you ask for exactly that.

              Providing [4m--ssl‐allow‐beast[24m multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it again with --no‐ssl‐al‐
              low‐beast.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐ssl‐allow‐beast https://example.com

       --ssl‐auto‐client‐cert
              Tell libcurl to automatically locate and use a client  certificate  for  authentication,  when  re‐
              quested by the server. This option is only supported for Schannel (the native Windows SSL library).
              Prior  to  7.77.0  this was the default behavior in libcurl with Schannel. Since the server can re‐
              quest any certificate that supports client authentication in the OS certificate store it could be a
              privacy violation and unexpected.

              Providing [4m--ssl‐auto‐client‐cert[24m multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it again  with  --no‐
              ssl‐auto‐client‐cert.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐ssl‐auto‐client‐cert https://example.com

       --ssl‐no‐revoke
              (Schannel)  This  option tells curl to disable certificate revocation checks.  WARNING: this option
              loosens the SSL security, and by using this flag you ask for exactly that.

              Providing [4m--ssl‐no‐revoke[24m multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it again  with  --no‐ssl‐no‐
              revoke.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐ssl‐no‐revoke https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐crlfile[24m. Added in 7.44.0.

       --ssl‐reqd
              (FTP  IMAP  POP3  SMTP  LDAP)  Require SSL/TLS for the connection. Terminates the connection if the
              transfer cannot be upgraded to use SSL/TLS.

              This option is handled in LDAP since version 7.81.0. It is fully supported by the OpenLDAP  backend
              and rejected by the generic ldap backend if explicit TLS is required.

              This  option  is  unnecessary if you use a URL scheme that in itself implies immediate and implicit
              use of TLS, like for FTPS, IMAPS, POP3S, SMTPS and LDAPS. Such transfers will always  fail  if  the
              TLS handshake does not work.

              This option was formerly known as --ftp‐ssl‐reqd.

              Providing [4m--ssl‐reqd[24m multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it again with --no‐ssl‐reqd.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐ssl‐reqd ftp://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐ssl[24m and [4m‐k,[24m [4m‐‐insecure[24m.

       --ssl‐revoke‐best‐effort
              (Schannel)  This  option tells curl to ignore certificate revocation checks when they failed due to
              missing/offline distribution points for the revocation check lists.

              Providing [4m--ssl‐revoke‐best‐effort[24m multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it again with --no‐
              ssl‐revoke‐best‐effort.

              Example:

       --ssl  (FTP IMAP POP3 SMTP LDAP) Warning: this is considered an insecure option. Consider using [4m--ssl‐reqd[0m
              instead to be sure curl upgrades to a secure connection.

              Try to use SSL/TLS for the connection. Reverts to a non‐secure connection if the  server  does  not
              support  SSL/TLS.  See also [4m--ftp‐ssl‐control[24m and [4m--ssl‐reqd[24m for different levels of encryption re‐
              quired.

              This option is handled in LDAP since version 7.81.0. It is fully supported by the OpenLDAP  backend
              and ignored by the generic ldap backend.

              Please note that a server may close the connection if the negotiation does not succeed.

              This option was formerly known as --ftp‐ssl. That option name can still be used but will be removed
              in a future version.

              Providing [4m--ssl[24m multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it again with --no‐ssl.

              (SSL)  This option previously asked curl to use SSLv2, but starting in curl 7.77.0 this instruction
              is ignored. SSLv2 is widely considered insecure (see RFC 6176).

              Providing [4m-2,[24m [4m--sslv2[24m multiple times has no extra effect.

       --stderr <file>
              Redirect all writes to stderr to the specified file instead. If the file name is a plain ’‐’, it is
              instead written to stdout.

              This option is global and does not need to be specified for each use of ‐‐next.

              Enables  the automatic use of bold font styles when writing HTTP headers to the terminal. Use --no‐
              styled‐output to switch them off.

              Styled output requires a terminal that supports bold fonts. This feature is not present on curl for
              Windows due to lack of this capability.

              This option is global and does not need to be specified for each use of ‐‐next.

              Providing [4m--styled‐output[24m multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it again  with  --no‐styled‐

       --tcp‐fastopen

              Enable  use  of  TCP Fast Open (RFC 7413). TCP Fast Open is a TCP extension that allows data to get
              sent earlier over the connection (before the final handshake ACK) if the  client  and  server  have
              been connected previously.

              Providing  [4m--tcp‐fastopen[24m  multiple  times  has  no  extra effect.  Disable it again with --no‐tcp‐
              fastopen.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐tcp‐fastopen https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐false‐start[24m. Added in 7.49.0.

       --tcp‐nodelay
              Turn on the TCP_NODELAY option. See the [4mcurl_easy_setopt(3)[24m man page for details about this option.

              Since 7.50.2, curl sets this option by default and you need to explicitly switch it off if  you  do
              not want it on.

              Providing  [4m--tcp‐nodelay[24m  multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it again with --no‐tcp‐node‐
              lay.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐tcp‐nodelay https://example.com

              See also [4m‐N,[24m [4m‐‐no‐buffer[24m.

       -t, --telnet‐option <opt=val>
              Pass options to the telnet protocol. Supported options are:

              TTYPE=<term> Sets the terminal type.

              XDISPLOC=<X display> Sets the X display location.

              NEW_ENV=<var,val> Sets an environment variable.

              [4m-t,[24m [4m--telnet‐option[24m can be used several times in a command line

              Example:
               curl ‐t TTYPE=vt100 telnet://example.com/

              See also [4m‐K,[24m [4m‐‐config[24m.

       --tftp‐blksize <value>
              (TFTP) Set TFTP BLKSIZE option (must be >512). This is the block size that curl  will  try  to  use
              when transferring data to or from a TFTP server. By default 512 bytes will be used.

              If [4m--tftp‐blksize[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐tftp‐blksize 1024 tftp://example.com/file

              See also [4m‐‐tftp‐no‐options[24m.

       --tftp‐no‐options
              (TFTP) Tells curl not to send TFTP options requests.

              This option improves interop with some legacy servers that do not acknowledge or properly implement
              TFTP options. When this option is used [4m--tftp‐blksize[24m is ignored.

              Providing  [4m--tftp‐no‐options[24m  multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it again with --no‐tftp‐
              no‐options.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐tftp‐no‐options tftp://192.168.0.1/

              See also [4m‐‐tftp‐blksize[24m. Added in 7.48.0.

       -z, --time‐cond <time>
              (HTTP FTP) Request a file that has been modified later than the given time and date,  or  one  that
              has been modified before that time. The <date expression> can be all sorts of date strings or if it
              does  not match any internal ones, it is taken as a filename and tries to get the modification date
              (mtime) from <file> instead. See the [4mcurl_getdate(3)[24m man pages for date expression details.

              Start the date expression with a dash (‐) to make it request for a document that is older than  the
              given date/time, default is a document that is newer than the specified date/time.

              If [4m-z,[24m [4m--time‐cond[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Examples:
               curl ‐z "Wed 01 Sep 2021 12:18:00" https://example.com
               curl ‐z "‐Wed 01 Sep 2021 12:18:00" https://example.com

       --tls‐max <VERSION>
              (TLS)  VERSION  defines  maximum  supported  TLS  version. The minimum acceptable version is set by
              tlsv1.0, tlsv1.1, tlsv1.2 or tlsv1.3.

              If the connection is done without TLS, this option has no effect. This includes QUIC‐using (HTTP/3)
              transfers.

              default
                     Use up to recommended TLS version.

              1.0    Use up to TLSv1.0.

              1.1    Use up to TLSv1.1.

              1.2    Use up to TLSv1.2.

              1.3    Use up to TLSv1.3.

              If [4m--tls‐max[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Examples:
               curl ‐‐tls‐max 1.2 https://example.com
               curl ‐‐tls‐max 1.3 ‐‐tlsv1.2 https://example.com

              libcurl was built to support TLS. Added in 7.54.0.

       --tls13‐ciphers <ciphersuite list>
              (TLS)  Specifies which cipher suites to use in the connection if it negotiates TLS 1.3. The list of
              ciphers suites must specify valid ciphers. Read up on TLS 1.3 cipher suite details on this URL:

              https://curl.se/docs/ssl‐ciphers.html

              This option is currently used only when curl is built to use OpenSSL 1.1.1 or later or Schannel. If
              you are using a different SSL backend you can try setting TLS 1.3 cipher suites by using the  [4m--ci‐[0m
              [4mphers[24m option.

              If [4m--tls13‐ciphers[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐tls13‐ciphers TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐ciphers[24m, [4m‐‐curves[24m and [4m‐‐proxy‐tls13‐ciphers[24m. Added in 7.61.0.

       --tlsauthtype <type>
              Set TLS authentication type. Currently, the only supported option is "SRP", for TLS‐SRP (RFC 5054).
              If [4m--tlsuser[24m and [4m--tlspassword[24m are specified but [4m--tlsauthtype[24m is not, then this option defaults to
              "SRP".  This  option  works only if the underlying libcurl is built with TLS‐SRP support, which re‐
              quires OpenSSL or GnuTLS with TLS‐SRP support.

              If [4m--tlsauthtype[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐tlsauthtype SRP https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐tlsuser[24m.

       --tlspassword <string>
              Set password for use with the TLS authentication method specified with [4m--tlsauthtype[24m. Requires that
              [4m--tlsuser[24m also be set.

              This option does not work with TLS 1.3.

              If [4m--tlspassword[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐tlspassword pwd ‐‐tlsuser user https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐tlsuser[24m.

       --tlsuser <name>
              Set username for use with the TLS authentication method specified with [4m--tlsauthtype[24m. Requires that
              [4m--tlspassword[24m also is set.

              This option does not work with TLS 1.3.

              If [4m--tlsuser[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐tlspassword pwd ‐‐tlsuser user https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐tlspassword[24m.

       --tlsv1.0
              (TLS) Forces curl to use TLS version 1.0 or later when connecting to a remote TLS server.

              In old versions of curl this option was documented to allow _only_ TLS 1.0.  That behavior was  in‐
              consistent depending on the TLS library. Use [4m--tls‐max[24m if you want to set a maximum TLS version.

              Providing [4m--tlsv1.0[24m multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐tlsv1.0 https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐tlsv1.3[24m. Added in 7.34.0.

       --tlsv1.1
              (TLS) Forces curl to use TLS version 1.1 or later when connecting to a remote TLS server.

              In  old versions of curl this option was documented to allow _only_ TLS 1.1.  That behavior was in‐
              consistent depending on the TLS library. Use [4m--tls‐max[24m if you want to set a maximum TLS version.

       --tlsv1.2
              (TLS) Forces curl to use TLS version 1.2 or later when connecting to a remote TLS server.

              In old versions of curl this option was documented to allow _only_ TLS 1.2.  That behavior was  in‐
              consistent depending on the TLS library. Use [4m--tls‐max[24m if you want to set a maximum TLS version.

              Providing [4m--tlsv1.2[24m multiple times has no extra effect.

              See also [4m‐‐tlsv1.3[24m and [4m‐‐tls‐max[24m. Added in 7.34.0.

       --tlsv1.3
              (TLS) Forces curl to use TLS version 1.3 or later when connecting to a remote TLS server.

              If the connection is done without TLS, this option has no effect. This includes QUIC‐using (HTTP/3)
              transfers.

              Note that TLS 1.3 is not supported by all TLS backends.

              Providing [4m--tlsv1.3[24m multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:

       -1, --tlsv1
              (TLS)  Tells  curl  to use at least TLS version 1.x when negotiating with a remote TLS server. That
              means TLS version 1.0 or higher

              Providing [4m-1,[24m [4m--tlsv1[24m multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐tlsv1 https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐http1.1[24m and [4m‐‐http2[24m. [4m‐1,[24m [4m‐‐tlsv1[24m requires that the underlying libcurl was built to  sup‐
              port TLS. This option is mutually exclusive to [4m‐‐tlsv1.1[24m and [4m‐‐tlsv1.2[24m and [4m‐‐tlsv1.3[24m.

       --tr‐encoding
              (HTTP)  Request  a compressed Transfer‐Encoding response using one of the algorithms curl supports,
              and uncompress the data while receiving it.

              Providing [4m--tr‐encoding[24m multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it again  with  --no‐tr‐encod‐
              ing.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐tr‐encoding https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐compressed[24m.

       --trace‐ascii <file>
              Enables  a full trace dump of all incoming and outgoing data, including descriptive information, to
              the given output file. Use "‐" as filename to have the output sent to stdout.

              This is similar to [4m--trace[24m, but leaves out the hex part and only shows the ASCII part of the  dump.
              It makes smaller output that might be easier to read for untrained humans.

              This option is global and does not need to be specified for each use of ‐‐next.

              If [4m--trace‐ascii[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐trace‐ascii log.txt https://example.com

              See also [4m‐v,[24m [4m‐‐verbose[24m and [4m‐‐trace[24m. This option is mutually exclusive to [4m‐‐trace[24m and [4m‐v,[24m [4m‐‐verbose[24m.

       --trace‐ids
              Prepends the transfer and connection identifiers to each trace or verbose line that curl displays.

              This option is global and does not need to be specified for each use of ‐‐next.

              Providing [4m--trace‐ids[24m multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it again with --no‐trace‐ids.

              Example:

              See also [4m‐‐trace[24m and [4m‐v,[24m [4m‐‐verbose[24m. Added in 8.2.0.

       --trace‐time
              Prepends a time stamp to each trace or verbose line that curl displays.

              This option is global and does not need to be specified for each use of ‐‐next.

              Providing [4m--trace‐time[24m multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it again with --no‐trace‐time.

              Example:

       --trace <file>
              Enables  a full trace dump of all incoming and outgoing data, including descriptive information, to
              the given output file. Use "‐" as filename to have the output sent to stdout. Use "%"  as  filename
              to have the output sent to stderr.

              This option is global and does not need to be specified for each use of ‐‐next.

              If [4m--trace[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:

              [4m‐‐verbose[24m and [4m‐‐trace‐ascii[24m.

       --unix‐socket <path>
              (HTTP) Connect through this Unix domain socket, instead of using the network.

              If [4m--unix‐socket[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐unix‐socket socket‐path https://example.com

              See also [4m‐‐abstract‐unix‐socket[24m. Added in 7.40.0.

       -T, --upload‐file <file>
              This transfers the specified local file to the remote URL. If there is no file part in  the  speci‐
              fied URL, curl will append the local file name. NOTE that you must use a trailing / on the last di‐
              rectory to really prove to Curl that there is no file name or curl will think that your last direc‐
              tory name is the remote file name to use. That will most likely cause the upload operation to fail.
              If this is used on an HTTP(S) server, the PUT command will be used.

              Use  the file name "‐" (a single dash) to use stdin instead of a given file.  Alternately, the file
              name "." (a single period) may be specified instead of "‐" to use stdin in non‐blocking mode to al‐
              low reading server output while stdin is being uploaded.

              You can specify one [4m-T,[24m [4m--upload‐file[24m for each URL on the command line. Each  [4m-T,[24m  [4m--upload‐file[24m  +
              URL  pair specifies what to upload and to where. curl also supports "globbing" of the [4m-T,[24m [4m--upload‐[0m
              [4mfile[24m argument, meaning that you can upload multiple files to a single URL by  using  the  same  URL
              globbing style supported in the URL.

              When  uploading to an SMTP server: the uploaded data is assumed to be RFC 5322 formatted. It has to
              feature the necessary set of headers and mail body formatted correctly by the user as curl will not
              transcode nor encode it further in any way.

              [4m-T,[24m [4m--upload‐file[24m can be used several times in a command line

              Examples:
               curl ‐T file https://example.com
               curl ‐T "img[1‐1000].png" ftp://ftp.example.com/
               curl ‐‐upload‐file "{file1,file2}" https://example.com

       --url‐query <data>
              (all) This option adds a piece of data, usually a name + value pair, to the end of  the  URL  query
              part. The syntax is identical to that used for [4m--data‐urlencode[24m with one extension:

              If the argument starts with a ’+’ (plus), the rest of the string is provided as‐is unencoded.

              The query part of a URL is the one following the question mark on the right end.

              [4m--url‐query[24m can be used several times in a command line

              Examples:
               curl ‐‐url‐query name=val https://example.com
               curl ‐‐url‐query =encodethis http://example.net/foo

              See also [4m‐‐data‐urlencode[24m and [4m‐G,[24m [4m‐‐get[24m. Added in 7.87.0.

       --url <url>
              Specify  a  URL  to  fetch. This option is mostly handy when you want to specify URL(s) in a config
              file.

              If the given URL is missing a scheme name (such as "http://" or "ftp://" etc) then curl will make a
              guess based on the host. If the outermost sub‐domain name matches DICT, FTP, IMAP,  LDAP,  POP3  or
              SMTP  then  that  protocol  will be used, otherwise HTTP will be used. Since 7.45.0 guessing can be
              disabled by setting a default protocol, see [4m--proto‐default[24m for details.

              To control where this URL is written, use the [4m-o,[24m [4m--output[24m or the [4m-O,[24m [4m--remote‐name[24m options.

              [1mWARNING[22m: On Windows, particular file:// accesses can be converted to network accesses by the  oper‐
              ating system. Beware!

              [4m--url[24m can be used several times in a command line

              Example:
               curl ‐‐url https://example.com

              See also [4m‐:,[24m [4m‐‐next[24m and [4m‐K,[24m [4m‐‐config[24m.

       -B, --use‐ascii
              (FTP  LDAP) Enable ASCII transfer. For FTP, this can also be enforced by using a URL that ends with
              ";type=A". This option causes data sent to stdout to be in text mode for win32 systems.

              Providing [4m-B,[24m [4m--use‐ascii[24m multiple times has no extra effect.   Disable  it  again  with  --no‐use‐
              ascii.

              Example:
               curl ‐B ftp://example.com/README

              See also [4m‐‐crlf[24m and [4m‐‐data‐ascii[24m.

       -A, --user‐agent <name>
              (HTTP)  Specify  the  User‐Agent string to send to the HTTP server. To encode blanks in the string,
              surround the string with single quote marks. This header can also be set with the [4m-H,[24m  [4m--header[24m  or
              the [4m--proxy‐header[24m options.

              If  you  give an empty argument to [4m-A,[24m [4m--user‐agent[24m (""), it will remove the header completely from
              the request. If you prefer a blank header, you can set it to a single space (" ").

              If [4m-A,[24m [4m--user‐agent[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐A "Agent 007" https://example.com

              See also [4m‐H,[24m [4m‐‐header[24m and [4m‐‐proxy‐header[24m.

       -u, --user <user:password>
              Specify the user name and password to use for server  authentication.  Overrides  [4m-n,[24m  [4m--netrc[24m  and
              [4m--netrc‐optional[24m.

              If you simply specify the user name, curl will prompt for a password.

              The  user  name  and  passwords are split up on the first colon, which makes it impossible to use a
              colon in the user name with this option. The password can, still.

              On systems where it works, curl will hide the given option argument from process listings. This  is
              not  enough  to protect credentials from possibly getting seen by other users on the same system as
              they will still be visible for a moment before cleared. Such sensitive  data  should  be  retrieved
              from a file instead or similar and never used in clear text in a command line.

              When  using  Kerberos  V5 with a Windows based server you should include the Windows domain name in
              the user name, in order for the server to successfully obtain a Kerberos Ticket.  If  you  do  not,
              then the initial authentication handshake may fail.

              When  using  NTLM,  the  user name can be specified simply as the user name, without the domain, if
              there is a single domain and forest in your setup for example.

              To specify the domain name use either Down‐Level Logon Name or UPN (User Principal  Name)  formats.
              For example, EXAMPLE\user and user@example.com respectively.

              If  you  use  a Windows SSPI‐enabled curl binary and perform Kerberos V5, Negotiate, NTLM or Digest
              authentication then you can tell curl to select the user name and password from your environment by
              specifying a single colon with this option: "‐u :".

              If [4m-u,[24m [4m--user[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐u user:secret https://example.com

              See also [4m‐n,[24m [4m‐‐netrc[24m and [4m‐K,[24m [4m‐‐config[24m.

       -v, --verbose
              Makes curl verbose during the operation. Useful for debugging and seeing what’s going on "under the
              hood". A line starting with ’>’ means "header data" sent by curl, ’<’ means "header data"  received
              by curl that is hidden in normal cases, and a line starting with ’*’ means additional info provided
              by curl.

              If you only want HTTP headers in the output, [4m-i,[24m [4m--include[24m or [4m-D,[24m [4m--dump‐header[24m might be more suit‐
              able options.

              If you think this option still does not give you enough details, consider using [4m--trace[24m or [4m--trace‐[0m
              [4mascii[24m instead.

              This option is global and does not need to be specified for each use of ‐‐next.

              Providing [4m-v,[24m [4m--verbose[24m multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it again with --no‐verbose.

              Example:
               curl ‐‐verbose https://example.com

              See  also [4m‐i,[24m [4m‐‐include[24m, [4m‐s,[24m [4m‐‐silent[24m, [4m‐‐trace[24m and [4m‐‐trace‐ascii[24m. This option is mutually exclusive
              to [4m‐‐trace[24m and [4m‐‐trace‐ascii[24m.

       -V, --version
              Displays information about curl and the libcurl version it uses.

              The first line includes the full version of curl, libcurl and other 3rd party libraries linked with
              the executable.

              The second line (starts with "Protocols:") shows all protocols that libcurl reports to support.

       -w, --write‐out <format>
              Make curl display information on stdout after a completed transfer. The format is a string that may
              contain  plain  text  mixed  with any number of variables. The format can be specified as a literal
              "string", or you can have curl read the format from a file with "@filename" and  to  tell  curl  to
              read the format from stdin you write "@‐".

              The  variables  present  in  the  output  format will be substituted by the value or text that curl
              thinks fit, as described below. All variables are specified as %{variable_name}  and  to  output  a
              normal % you just write them as %%. You can output a newline by using \n, a carriage return with \r
              and a tab space with \t.

              The  output will be written to standard output, but this can be switched to standard error by using
              %{stderr}.

              Output HTTP headers from the most recent request by using [1m%header{name} [22mwhere [1mname [22mis the case  in‐
              sensitive  name of the header (without the trailing colon). The header contents are exactly as sent
              over the network, with leading and trailing whitespace trimmed. Added in curl 7.84.0.

              [1mNOTE: [22mIn Windows the %‐symbol is a special symbol used to expand environment  variables.  In  batch
              files  all  occurrences of % must be doubled when using this option to properly escape. If this op‐
              tion is used at the command prompt then the % cannot be escaped and unintended expansion is  possi‐
              ble.

              The variables available are:

              [1mcerts          [22mOutput  the  certificate  chain with details. Supported only by the OpenSSL, GnuTLS,
                             Schannel, NSS, GSKit and Secure Transport backends. (Added in 7.88.0)

                             The ultimate filename that curl writes out to. This is only meaningful  if  curl  is
                             told to write to a file with the [4m-O,[24m [4m--remote‐name[24m or [4m-o,[24m [4m--output[24m option. It’s most
                             useful in combination with the [4m-J,[24m [4m--remote‐header‐name[24m option.

                             provided as arrays, since in the case of multiple headers there can be multiple val‐
                             ues. (Added in 7.83.0)

                             The header names provided in lowercase, listed in order of appearance over the wire.
                             Except for duplicated headers. They are grouped on  the  first  occurrence  of  that
                             header, each value is presented in the JSON array.

              [1mhttp_code      [22mThe  numerical  response code that was found in the last retrieved HTTP(S) or FTP(s)

              [1mnum_certs      [22mNumber of server certificates received in the TLS handshake. Supported only  by  the
                             OpenSSL,  GnuTLS,  Schannel,  NSS,  GSKit  and  Secure Transport backends. (Added in
                             7.88.0)

              [1mnum_redirects  [22mNumber of redirects that were followed in the request.

              [1monerror        [22mThe  rest  of  the  output  is only shown if the transfer returned a non‐zero error.
                             (Added in 7.75.0)

              [1mproxy_ssl_verify_result[0m

              If [4m-w,[24m [4m--write‐out[24m is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl ‐w ’%{response_code}\n’ https://example.com

              See also [4m‐v,[24m [4m‐‐verbose[24m and [4m‐I,[24m [4m‐‐head[24m.

       --xattr
              When  saving  output  to  a file, this option tells curl to store certain file metadata in extended
              file attributes. Currently, the URL is stored in the xdg.origin.url attribute and,  for  HTTP,  the
              content type is stored in the mime_type attribute. If the file system does not support extended at‐
              tributes, a warning is issued.

              Providing [4m--xattr[24m multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it again with --no‐xattr.

              Example:

              Default config file, see [4m-K,[24m [4m--config[24m for details.

[1mENVIRONMENT[0m
       The  environment variables can be specified in lower case or upper case. The lower case version has prece‐
       dence. http_proxy is an exception as it is only available in lower case.

       Using an environment variable to set the proxy has the same effect as using the [4m-x,[24m [4m--proxy[24m option.

       http_proxy [protocol://]<host>[:port]
              Sets the proxy server to use for HTTP.

       HTTPS_PROXY [protocol://]<host>[:port]
              Sets the proxy server to use for HTTPS.

       [url‐protocol]_PROXY [protocol://]<host>[:port]
              Sets the proxy server to use for [url‐protocol], where the protocol is a protocol  that  curl  sup‐
              ports and as specified in a URL. FTP, FTPS, POP3, IMAP, SMTP, LDAP, etc.

       ALL_PROXY [protocol://]<host>[:port]
              Sets the proxy server to use if no protocol‐specific proxy is set.

       NO_PROXY <comma‐separated list of hosts/domains>
              list of host names that should not go through any proxy. If set to an asterisk '*’ only, it matches
              all  hosts.  Each name in this list is matched as either a domain name which contains the hostname,
              or the hostname itself.

              This environment variable disables use of the proxy even when specified with the  [4m-x,[24m  [4m--proxy[24m  op‐
              tion.  That  is  [1mNO_PROXY=direct.example.com  curl  -x http://proxy.example.com http://direct.exam‐[0m
              [1mple.com [22maccesses the target URL directly, and [1mNO_PROXY=direct.example.com curl -x  http://proxy.ex‐[0m
              [1mample.com http://somewhere.example.com [22maccesses the target URL through the proxy.

              The list of host names can also be include numerical IP addresses, and IPv6 versions should then be
              given without enclosing brackets.

              Since 7.86.0, IP addresses can be specified using CIDR notation: an appended slash and number spec‐
              ifies  the  number  of  "network  bits"  out  of  the address to use in the comparison. For example
              "192.168.0.0/16" would match all addresses starting with "192.168".

       APPDATA <dir>
              On Windows, this variable is used when trying to find the home directory. If the primary home vari‐
              able are all unset.

       COLUMNS <terminal width>
              If set, the specified number of characters will be used as the terminal width when the  alternative
              progress‐bar is shown. If not set, curl will try to figure it out using other ways.

       CURL_CA_BUNDLE <file>
              If set, will be used as the [4m--cacert[24m value.

       CURL_HOME <dir>
              If  set,  is  the first variable curl checks when trying to find its home directory. If not set, it
              continues to check [4mXDG_CONFIG_HOME[0m

       CURL_SSL_BACKEND <TLS backend>
              If curl was built with support for "MultiSSL", meaning that it has built‐in support for  more  than
              one  TLS backend, this environment variable can be set to the case insensitive name of the particu‐
              lar backend to use when curl is invoked. Setting a name that is not  a  built‐in  alternative  will
              make curl stay with the default.

              SSL backend names (case‐insensitive): bearssl, gnutls, gskit, mbedtls, nss, openssl, rustls, schan‐
              nel, secure‐transport, wolfssl

       HOME <dir>
              If  set, this is used to find the home directory when that is needed. Like when looking for the de‐
              fault .curlrc. [4mCURL_HOME[24m and [4mXDG_CONFIG_HOME[24m have preference.

       QLOGDIR <directory name>
              If curl was built with HTTP/3 support, setting this environment variable to a local directory  will
              make  curl produce qlogs in that directory, using file names named after the destination connection
              id (in hex). Do note that these files can become rather large. Works with both QUIC backends.

       SHELL  Used on VMS when trying to detect if using a DCL or a "unix" shell.

       SSL_CERT_DIR <dir>
              If set, will be used as the [4m--capath[24m value.

       SSL_CERT_FILE <path>
              If set, will be used as the [4m--cacert[24m value.

       SSLKEYLOGFILE <file name>
              If you set this environment variable to a file name, curl will store TLS secrets from  its  connec‐
              tions in that file when invoked to enable you to analyze the TLS traffic in real time using network
              analyzing  tools  such as Wireshark. This works with the following TLS backends: OpenSSL, libressl,
              BoringSSL, GnuTLS, NSS and wolfSSL.

       USERPROFILE <dir>
              On Windows, this variable is used when trying to find the home directory. If  the  other,  primary,
              variable are all unset. If set, curl will use the path "$USERPROFILE\Application Data".

       XDG_CONFIG_HOME <dir>
              If [4mCURL_HOME[24m is not set, this variable is checked when looking for a default .curlrc file.

[1mPROXY PROTOCOL PREFIXES[0m
       The proxy string may be specified with a protocol:// prefix to specify alternative proxy protocols.

       If no protocol is specified in the proxy string or if the string does not match a supported one, the proxy
       will be treated as an HTTP proxy.

       The supported proxy protocol prefixes are as follows:

       http://
              Makes it use it as an HTTP proxy. The default if no scheme prefix is used.

       https://
              Makes it treated as an [1mHTTPS [22mproxy.

       socks4://
              Makes it the equivalent of [4m--socks4[0m

       socks4a://
              Makes it the equivalent of [4m--socks4a[0m

       socks5://
              Makes it the equivalent of [4m--socks5[0m

       socks5h://
              Makes it the equivalent of [4m--socks5‐hostname[0m

[1mEXIT CODES[0m
       There  are  a  bunch of different error codes and their corresponding error messages that may appear under
       error conditions. At the time of this writing, the exit codes are:

       0      Success. The operation completed successfully according to the instructions.

       1      Unsupported protocol. This build of curl has no support for this protocol.

       2      Failed to initialize.

       3      URL malformed. The syntax was not correct.

       4      A feature or option that was needed to perform the desired request was not enabled or  was  explic‐
              itly  disabled  at  build‐time.  To  make  curl able to do this, you probably need another build of
              libcurl.

       5      Could not resolve proxy. The given proxy host could not be resolved.

       6      Could not resolve host. The given remote host could not be resolved.

       8      Weird server reply. The server sent data curl could not parse.

       9      FTP access denied. The server denied login or denied access to the particular resource or directory
              you wanted to reach. Most often you tried to change to a directory  that  does  not  exist  on  the
              server.

       10     FTP accept failed. While waiting for the server to connect back when an active FTP session is used,
              an error code was sent over the control connection or similar.

       11     FTP weird PASS reply. Curl could not parse the reply sent to the PASS request.

       12     During  an active FTP session while waiting for the server to connect back to curl, the timeout ex‐
              pired.

       13     FTP weird PASV reply, Curl could not parse the reply sent to the PASV request.

       14     FTP weird 227 format. Curl could not parse the 227‐line the server sent.

       15     FTP cannot use host. Could not resolve the host IP we got in the 227‐line.

       16     HTTP/2 error. A problem was detected in the HTTP2 framing layer. This is somewhat generic  and  can
              be one out of several problems, see the error message for details.

       17     FTP could not set binary. Could not change transfer method to binary.

       18     Partial file. Only a part of the file was transferred.

       22     HTTP  page  not  retrieved. The requested URL was not found or returned another error with the HTTP
              error code being 400 or above. This return code only appears if [4m-f,[24m [4m--fail[24m is used.

       23     Write error. Curl could not write data to a local filesystem or similar.

       25     FTP could not STOR file. The server denied the STOR operation, used for FTP uploading.

       26     Read error. Various reading problems.

       28     Operation timeout. The specified time‐out period was reached according to the conditions.

       30     FTP PORT failed. The PORT command failed. Not all FTP servers support the PORT command, try doing a
              transfer using PASV instead!

       31     FTP could not use REST. The REST command failed. This command is used for resumed FTP transfers.

       33     HTTP range error. The range "command" did not work.

       45     Interface error. A specified outgoing interface could not be used.

       47     Too many redirects. When following redirects, curl hit the maximum amount.

       48     Unknown option specified to libcurl. This indicates that you passed a weird option to curl that was
              passed on to libcurl and rejected. Read up in the manual!

       49     Malformed telnet option.

       52     The server did not reply anything, which here is considered an error.
