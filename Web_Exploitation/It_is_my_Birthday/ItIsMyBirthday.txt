Description
I sent out 2 invitations to all of my friends for my birthday! I'll know if they get stolen because the two invites look similar, and they even have the same md5 hash, but they are slightly different! You wouldn't believe how long it took me to find a collision. Anyway, see if you're invited by submitting 2 PDFs to my website. http://mercury.picoctf.net:63578/


Hints:
Look at the category of this problem.

How may a PHP site check the rules in the description?



Process:

wget two files with the same md5 hash and changed them to .pdf

uploadet them and got redirected to the php code where i found the flag in a comment
