Description
Can you crack the password to get the flag? Download the password checker here and you'll need the encrypted flag in the same directory too.


Hints:
Does that encoding look familiar?

The str_xor function does not need to be reverse engineered for this challenge.


Process:

wget

watched at code:

if( user_pw == chr(0x33) + chr(0x39) + chr(0x63) + chr(0x65) ): looks sus

make a new script:
print(chr(0x33) + chr(0x39) + chr(0x63) + chr(0x65))
