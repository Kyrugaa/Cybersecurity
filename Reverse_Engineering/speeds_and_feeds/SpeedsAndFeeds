Description
There is something on my shop network running at nc mercury.picoctf.net 20301, but I can't tell what it is. Can you?

Hints:
What language does a CNC machine use?


Prozess:

netcat the address, gives us RS-274 (G-Code) code

safed cnc inputs in .gcode file
visited NC Viewer and type out the flag:
picoCTF{num3r1cal_c0ntr0l_68a8fe29}
