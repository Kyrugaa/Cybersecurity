Description
Can you crack the password to get the flag? Download the password checker here and you'll need the encrypted flag and the hash in the same directory too. Here's a dictionary with all possible passwords based on the password conventions we've seen so far.


Hints:
Opening a file in Python is crucial to using the provided dictionary.

You may need to trim the whitespace from the dictionary word before hashing. Look up the Python string function, strip

The str_xor function does not need to be reverse engineered for this challenge.




Process:

wget

new function to brute force every password from the dictionary.txt:

def check():

    file = open('dictionary.txt', 'r')
    pos_pw_list = file.read()

    psw = pos_pw_list.split('\n')

    print(pos_pw_list)


    for i in psw:
        print(i)
        user_pw_hash = hash_pw(i)
        
        if( user_pw_hash == correct_pw_hash ):
            print("Welcome back... your flag, user:")
            decryption = str_xor(flag_enc.decode(), i)
            print(decryption)
            break
        else:
            print("That password is incorrect")
