Description
Can you find the flag in file? This would be really tedious to look through manually, something tells me there is a better way.


Hints:
grep tutorial


Prozess:
└─# strings file | grep pico   
picoCTF{grep_is_good_to_find_things_5af9d829}


# The strings below are 7 possibilities for the correct password. 
#   (Only 1 is correct)
pos_pw_list = ["6997", "3ac8", "f0ac", "4b17", "ec27", "4e66", "865e"]


┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Desktop/PicoCTF/General Skills/PW_Crack_3]
└─$ python level3.py 
Please enter correct password for flag: 865e
Welcome back... your flag, user:
